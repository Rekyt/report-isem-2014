	abstract = {Rapid advances in {DNA} synthesis techniques have made it possible to engineer viruses, biochemical pathways and assemble bacterial genomes. Here, we report the synthesis of a functional 272,871–base pair designer eukaryotic chromosome, {synIII}, which is based on the 316,617–base pair native Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome {III}. Changes to {synIII} include {TAG}/{TAA} stop-codon replacements, deletion of subtelomeric regions, introns, transfer {RNAs}, transposons, and silent mating loci as well as insertion of {loxPsym} sites to enable genome scrambling. {SynIII} is functional in S. cerevisiae. Scrambling of the chromosome in a heterozygous diploid reveals a large increase in a-mater derivatives resulting from loss of the {MATα} allele on {synIII}. The complete design and synthesis of {synIII} establishes S. cerevisiae as the basis for designer eukaryotic genome biology.},

However, our current understanding of eukaryotic genomes is extremely biased, leading to a skewed view of eukaryotic biology. We argue that a phylogeny-driven initiative to cover the full eukaryotic diversity is needed to overcome this bias. We encourage the community: (i) to sequence a representative of the neglected groups available at public culture collections, (ii) to increase our culturing efforts, and (iii) to embrace single cell genomics to access organisms refractory to propagation in culture. We hope that the community will welcome this proposal, explore the approaches suggested, and join efforts to sequence the full diversity of eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {Whole genome duplications have occurred recurrently throughout the evolutionary history of eukaryotes. The resulting genetic and phenotypic changes can influence physiological and ecological responses to the environment; however, the impact of genome copy number on evolvability has rarely been examined experimentally. Here, we evaluate the effect of genome duplication on the ability to respond to selection for early flowering time in lines drawn from naturally occurring diploid and autotetraploid populations of the plant Chamerion angustifolium (fireweed). We contrast this with the result of four generations of selection on synthesized neoautotetraploids, whose genic variability is similar to diploids but genome copy number is similar to autotetraploids. In addition, we examine correlated responses to selection in all three groups. Diploid and both extant tetraploid and neoautotetraploid lines responded to selection with significant reductions in time to flowering. Evolvability, measured as realized heritability, was significantly lower in extant tetraploids ( = 0.31) than diploids ( = 0.40). Neotetraploids exhibited the highest evolutionary response ( = 0.55). The rapid shift in flowering time in neotetraploids was associated with an increase in phenotypic variability across generations, but not with change in genome size or phenotypic correlations among traits. Our results suggest that whole genome duplications, without hybridization, may initially alter evolutionary rate, and that the dynamic nature of neoautopolyploids may contribute to the prevalence of polyploidy throughout eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {It is becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile the observed extent of horizontal gene transfers with the central metaphor of a great tree uniting all evolving entities on the planet. In this manuscript we describe the Public Goods Hypothesis and show that it is appropriate in order to describe biological evolution on the planet. According to this hypothesis, nucleotide sequences (genes, promoters, exons, etc.) are simply seen as goods, passed from organism to organism through both vertical and horizontal transfer. Public goods sequences are defined by having the properties of being largely non-excludable (no organism can be effectively prevented from accessing these sequences) and non-rival (while such a sequence is being used by one organism it is also available for use by another organism). The universal nature of genetic systems ensures that such non-excludable sequences exist and non-excludability explains why we see a myriad of genes in different combinations in sequenced genomes. There are three features of the public goods hypothesis. Firstly, segments of {DNA} are seen as public goods, available for all organisms to integrate into their genomes. Secondly, we expect the evolution of mechanisms for {DNA} sharing and of defense mechanisms against {DNA} intrusion in genomes. Thirdly, we expect that we do not see a global tree-like pattern. Instead, we expect local tree-like patterns to emerge from the combination of a commonage of genes and vertical inheritance of genomes by cell division. Indeed, while genes are theoretically public goods, in reality, some genes are excludable, particularly, though not only, when they have variant genetic codes or behave as coalition or club goods, available for all organisms of a coalition to integrate into their genomes, and non-rival within the club. We view the Tree of Life hypothesis as a regionalized instance of the Public Goods hypothesis, just like classical mechanics and euclidean geometry are seen as regionalized instances of quantum mechanics and Riemannian geometry respectively. We argue for this change using an axiomatic approach that shows that the Public Goods hypothesis is a better accommodation of the observed data than the Tree of Life hypothesis.},

Here, we examined the effects of both polyploid and nonpolyploid duplications on genes encoding the major functional groups of photosynthesis (photosystem I, photosystem {II}, the light-harvesting complex, and the Calvin cycle) in the cultivated soybean (Glycine max), which has experienced two rounds of whole-genome duplication. Photosystem gene families exhibit retention patterns consistent with dosage sensitivity (preferential retention of polyploid duplicates and elimination of nonpolyploid duplicates), whereas Calvin cycle and light-harvesting complex gene families do not. We observed similar patterns in barrel medic (Medicago truncatula), which shared the older genome duplication with soybean but has evolved independently for approximately 50 million years, and in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which experienced two nested polyploidy events independent from the legume duplications. In both soybean and Arabidopsis, Calvin cycle gene duplicates exhibit a greater capacity for functional differentiation than do duplicates within the photosystems, which likely explains the greater retention of ancient, nonpolyploid duplicates and larger average gene family size for the Calvin cycle relative to the photosystems.},

	abstract = {Phylogeny, be it morphological or molecular, has long tried to explain the extant biodiversity by the Tree of Species, which is a logical consequence of strict Darwinian evolutionary principles. Through constant improvement of both methods and data sets, some parts of this diversity have actually been demonstrated to be the result of a tree-like process. For some other parts, and especially for prokaryotes, different molecular markers have, however, produced different evolutionary trees, preventing the reconstruction of such a Tree. While technical artifacts could be blamed for these discrepancies, Lateral Gene Transfers are now largely held for responsible, and their existence requires an extension of the Darwinian framework, since genetic material is not always vertically inherited from parents to offspring. Through a variety of biological processes, sometimes large parts of {DNA} are exchanged between phylogenetically distant contemporary organisms, especially between those sharing the same environment. While mainly concerning prokaryotes, Lateral Gene Transfers have been also demonstrated to affect eukaryotes, and even multicellular ones, like plants or animals. Most of the time, these transfers allow important adaptations and the colonisation of new niches. The quantitative and qualitative importance of genetic transfers has thus severely challenged the very existence of a universal Tree of Species, since genetic connections, at least for microbes, seem more reticulated than tree-like. Even traditional biological concepts, like the concept of species, need to be re-evaluated in the light of recent discoveries. In short, instead of focusing on a elusive universal tree, biologists are now considering the whole forest corresponding to the multiple processes of inheritance, both vertical and horizontal. This constitutes the major challenge of evolutionary biology for the years to come. To cite this article: P. Lopez, E. Bapteste, C. R. Biologies 332 (2009).},

	abstract = {Finding where transcription factors ({TFs}) bind to the {DNA} is of key importance to decipher gene regulation at a transcriptional level. Classically, computational prediction of {TF} binding sites ({TFBSs}) is based on basic position weight matrices ({PWMs}) which quantitatively score binding motifs based on the observed nucleotide patterns in a set of {TFBSs} for the corresponding {TF}. Such models make the strong assumption that each nucleotide participates independently in the corresponding {DNA}-protein interaction and do not account for flexible length motifs. We introduce transcription factor flexible models ({TFFMs}) to represent {TF} binding properties. Based on hidden Markov models, {TFFMs} are flexible, and can model both position interdependence within {TFBSs} and variable length motifs within a single dedicated framework. The availability of thousands of experimentally validated {DNA}-{TF} interaction sequences from {ChIP}-seq allows for the generation of models that perform as well as {PWMs} for stereotypical {TFs} and can improve performance for {TFs} with flexible binding characteristics. We present a new graphical representation of the motifs that convey properties of position interdependence. {TFFMs} have been assessed on {ChIP}-seq data sets coming from the {ENCODE} project, revealing that they can perform better than both {PWMs} and the dinucleotide weight matrix extension in discriminating {ChIP}-seq from background sequences. Under the assumption that {ChIP}-seq signal values are correlated with the affinity of the {TF}-{DNA} binding, we find that {TFFM} scores correlate with {ChIP}-seq peak signals. Moreover, using available {TF}-{DNA} affinity measurements for the Max {TF}, we demonstrate that {TFFMs} constructed from {ChIP}-seq data correlate with published experimentally measured {DNA}-binding affinities. Finally, {TFFMs} allow for the straightforward computation of an integrated {TF} occupancy score across a sequence. These results demonstrate the capacity of {TFFMs} to accurately model {DNA}-protein interactions, while providing a single unified framework suitable for the next generation of {TFBS} prediction.},

In this study, we describe the details of the evolutionary process of the tomato genome by detecting collinearity blocks and dating the {WGD} events on the tree of life by combining two different methods: synonymous substitution rates (Ks) and phylogenetic trees. In total, 593 collinearity blocks were discovered out of 12 pseudo-chromosomes constructed. It was evident that chromosome 2 had experienced an intra-chromosomal duplication event. Major inter-chromosomal duplication occurred among all the pseudo-chromosome. We calculated the Ks value of these collinearity blocks. Two peaks of Ks distribution were found, corresponding to two {WGD} events occurring approximately 36–82 million years ago ({MYA}) and 148–205 {MYA}. Additionally, the results of phylogenetic trees suggested that the more recent {WGD} event may have occurred after the divergence of the rosid-asterid clade, but before the major diversification in Solanaceae. The older {WGD} event was shown to have occurred before the divergence of the rosid-asterid clade and after the divergence of rice-Arabidopsis (monocot-dicot).},

	abstract = {Among vertebrates, teleost fishes have evolved the most impressive adaptations to variable oxygen tensions in water (Shoubridge and Hochachka 1980; Nilsson and Randall 2010). Under conditions of oxygen deprivation (hypoxia), major changes in gene expression are mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors ({HIF} alpha). Here we show that hif alpha genes were duplicated in the teleost specific whole-genome duplication. Although one of each paralogous gene pair was lost in most teleosts, both copies were retained in cyprinids. Computational analyses suggest that these duplicates have become subfunctionalized with complementary changes in coding and regulatory sequences within each paralogous gene pair. We tested our predictions with comparisons of hif alpha transcription in zebrafish, a cyprinid, and sturgeon, an outgroup that diverged from teleosts before the duplication event. Our experiments revealed distinct transcriptional profiles in the cyprinid duplicates: while one of each paralogous pair maintained the ancestral developmental response, the other was more sensitive to changes in oxygen tension. These results demonstrate the subfunctionalization of cyprinid hif alpha paralogs for specialized roles in development and the hypoxic stress response.},

	abstract = {Most terrestrial tardigrade species possess the ability to enter a reversible ametabolic state termed anhydrobiosis in response to desiccation. In the anhydrobiotic state, tardigrades display an incredible capacity to tolerate extreme environmental stress, not necessarily encountered in their natural habitat. In this study, we determine the effect of different extreme stresses on initial survival, long-term survival and fecundity of selected species of limno-terrestrial tardigrades. The primary focus was to assess the effect of cosmic radiation. This was achieved through the {RoTaRad} (Rotifers, Tardigrades and Radiation) project on the {BIOPAN} 6 mission, funded by Agenzia Spaziale Italiana under the European Space Agency. To test their tolerance of space environment, tardigrades were sent into low earth orbit, and exposed to cosmic radiation and a microgravity environment. Experiments on Whatman-3 filters show an effect of cosmic radiation on the survival of the eutardigrade Richtersius coronifer just after returning to Earth; however, after 2 years of desiccation on Whatman-3 filters, none of the tardigrades previously exposed to cosmic radiation could be revived. In a microcosmos experiment, the tardigrades R. coronifer, Ramazzottius oberhauseri and Echiniscus testudo were desiccated on a moss substrate together with rotifers and nematodes. Very low survival rates were observed in this experiment, likely due to the applied desiccation protocol. Embryos of the tardigrade Milnesium tardigradum were also exposed to cosmic radiation; they all hatched in the laboratory after the flight. In addition, experiments testing extreme cold and vacuum tolerance in R. coronifer show that tardigrades in anhydrobiosis are unaffected by these conditions.},

Both the map self-comparison approach and a phylogenetic analysis revealed that gene families identified as tetralogous on human chromosomes 1/2/8/20 arose by small-scale duplication events that occurred at widely different time points in animal evolution. Furthermore, the data discount the likelihood that tree topologies of the form ((A,B)(C,D)) are best explained by the octoploidy hypothesis.

Previously, we demonstrated that a mechanism of dispersal limitation also fits {RSA} data well. Here we compare fits of the dispersal and density-dependence mechanisms for empirical {RSA} data on tree species in six New and Old World tropical forests and show that both mechanisms offer sufficient and independent explanations. We suggest that {RSA} data cannot by themselves be used to discriminate among these explanations of {RSA} patterns—empirical studies will be required to determine whether {RSA} patterns are due to one or the other mechanism, or to some combination of both.},

Here, we describe evolutionary rates for 11,492 ortholog pairs between Arabidopsis thaliana and A. lyrata and investigate possible contributors to rate variation among these genes. Rates of evolution at synonymous sites vary along chromosomes, suggesting that mutation rates vary on genomic scales, perhaps as a function of recombination rate. Rates of evolution at nonsynonymous sites correlate most strongly with expression patterns, but they also vary as to whether a gene is duplicated and retained after a whole-genome duplication ({WGD}) event. {WGD} genes evolve more slowly, on average, than nonduplicated genes and non-{WGD} duplicates. We hypothesize that levels and patterns of expression are not only the major determinants that explain nonsynonymous rate variation among genes but also a critical determinant of gene retention after duplication.},

Recent genomic investigations not only indicate that polyploidy is ubiquitous among angiosperms, but also suggest several ancient genome-doubling events. These include ancient whole genome duplication ({WGD}) events in basal angiosperm lineages, as well as a proposed paleohexaploid event that may have occurred close to the eudicot divergence. However, there is currently no evidence for {WGD} in Amborella, the putative sister species to other extant angiosperms. The question is no longer “What proportion of angiosperms are polyploid?”, but “How many episodes of polyploidy characterize any given lineage?” New algorithms provide promise that ancestral genomes can be reconstructed for deep divergences (e.g., it may be possible to reconstruct the ancestral eudicot or even the ancestral angiosperm genome). Comparisons of diversification rates suggest that genome doubling may have led to a dramatic increase in species richness in several angiosperm lineages, including Poaceae, Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae. However, additional genomic studies are needed to pinpoint the exact phylogenetic placement of the ancient polyploidy events within these lineages and to determine when novel genes resulting from polyploidy have enabled adaptive radiations.},

	abstract = {Background
The lack of correlation between genome size and organismal complexity is understood in terms of the massive presence of repetitive and non-coding {DNA}. This non-coding subgenome has long been called “junk” {DNA}. However, it might have important functions. Generation of junk {DNA} depends on proliferation of selfish {DNA} elements and on local or global {DNA} duplication followed by genic non-fonctionalization.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Evidence from genomic analyses and experimental data indicates that Whole Genome Duplications ({WGD}) are often followed by a return to the diploid state, through {DNA} deletions and intra/interchromosomal rearrangements. We use simple theoretical models and simulations to explore how a {WGD} accompanied by sequence deletions might affect the dosage balance often required among several gene products involved in regulatory processes. We find that potential genomic deletions leading to changes in nuclear and cell volume might potentially perturb gene dosage balance.

Conclusions/Significance
The potentially negative impact of {DNA} deletions can be buffered if deleted genic {DNA} is, at least temporarily, replaced by repetitive {DNA} so that the nuclear/cell volume remains compatible with normal living. Thus, we speculate that retention of non-functionalized non-coding {DNA}, and replacement of deleted {DNA} through proliferation of selfish elements, might help avoid dosage imbalances in cycles of polyploidization and diploidization, which are particularly frequent in plants.},

Both studies suggest that at least one round of genome duplication occurred in the Gossypium lineage. Also, gene densities in corresponding regions from Gossypium raimondii, V. vinifera, Arabidopsis thaliana and Carica papaya genomes are similar, despite the huge difference in their genome sizes and the different number of {WGDs} each genome has experienced.

	abstract = {Gene duplicates are a major source of evolutionary novelties in the form of new or specialized functions and play a key role in speciation. Gene duplicates are generated through whole genome duplications ({WGD}) or small-scale genome duplications ({SSD}). Although {WGD} preserves the stoichiometric relationships between duplicates, those arising from {SSD} are usually unbalanced and are expected to follow different evolutionary dynamics than those formed by {WGD}. To dissect the role of the mechanism of duplication in these differential dynamics and determine whether this role was shared across species, we performed a genome wide evolutionary analysis of gene duplications arising from the most recent {WGD} events and contemporary episodes of {SSD} in four model species representing distinct plant evolutionary lineages. We found an excess of relaxed purifying selection after duplication in {SSD} paralogs compared with {WGD}, most of which may have been the result of functional divergence events between gene copies as estimated by measures of genetic distances. These differences were significant in three angiosperm genomes but not in the moss species Physcomitrella patens. Although the comparison of models of evolution does not attribute a relevant role to the mechanism of duplication in the evolution duplicates, distribution of retained genes among Gene Ontology functional categories support the conclusion that evolution of gene duplicates depends on its origin of duplication ({WGD} and {SSD}) but, most importantly, on the species. Similar lineage-specific biases were also observed in protein network connectivity, translational efficiency, and selective constraints acting on synonymous codon usage. Although the mechanism of duplication may determine gene retention, our results attribute a dominant role to the species in determining the ultimate pattern of duplicate gene retention and reveal an unanticipated complexity in the evolutionary dynamics and functional specialization of duplicated genes in plants.},

	abstract = {Polyploidy, the condition of possessing more than two complete genomes in a cell, has intrigued biologists for almost a century. Polyploidy is found in many plants and some animal species and today we know that polyploidy has had a role in the evolution of all angiosperms. Despite its widespread occurrence, the direct effect of polyploidy on evolutionary success of a species is still largely unknown. Over the years many attractive hypotheses have been proposed in an attempt to assign functionality to the increased content of a duplicated genome. Among these hypotheses are the proposal that genome doubling confers distinct advantages to a polyploid and that these advantages allow polyploids to thrive in environments that pose challenges to the polyploid’s diploid progenitors. This article revisits these long-standing questions and explores how the integration of recent genomic developments with ecological, physiological and evolutionary perspectives has contributed to addressing unresolved problems about the role of polyploidy. Although unsatisfactory, the current conclusion has to be that despite significant progress, there still isn’t enough information to unequivocally answer many unresolved questions about cause and effect of polyploidy on evolutionary success of a species. There is, however, reason to believe that the increasingly integrative approaches discussed here should allow us in the future to make more direct connections between the effects of polyploidy on the genome and the responses this condition elicits from the organism living in its natural environment.},

	abstract = {Metabolism is built on a foundation of organic chemistry, and employs structures and interactions at many scales. Despite these sources of complexity, metabolism also displays striking and robust regularities in the forms of modularity and hierarchy, which may be described compactly in terms of relatively few principles of composition. These regularities render metabolic architecture comprehensible as a system, and also suggests the order in which layers of that system came into existence. In addition metabolism also serves as a foundational layer in other hierarchies, up to at least the levels of cellular integration including bioenergetics and molecular replication, and trophic ecology. The recapitulation of patterns first seen in metabolism, in these higher levels, motivates us to interpret metabolism as a source of causation or constraint on many forms of organization in the biosphere. Many of the forms of modularity and hierarchy exhibited by metabolism are readily interpreted as stages in the emergence of catalytic control by living systems over organic chemistry, sometimes recapitulating or incorporating geochemical mechanisms.We identify as modules, either subsets of chemicals and reactions, or subsets of functions, that are re-used in many contexts with a conserved internal structure. At the small molecule substrate level, module boundaries are often associated with the most complex reaction mechanisms, catalyzed by highly conserved enzymes. Cofactors form a biosynthetically and functionally distinctive control layer over the small-molecule substrate. The most complex members among the cofactors are often associated with the reactions at module boundaries in the substrate networks, while simpler cofactors participate in widely generalized reactions. The highly tuned chemical structures of cofactors (sometimes exploiting distinctive properties of the elements of the periodic table) thereby act as ‘keys’ that incorporate classes of organic reactions within biochemistry.Module boundaries provide the interfaces where change is concentrated, when we catalogue extant diversity of metabolic phenotypes. The same modules that organize the compositional diversity of metabolism are argued, with many explicit examples, to have governed long-term evolution. Early evolution of core metabolism, and especially of carbon-fixation, appears to have required very few innovations, and to have used few rules of composition of conserved modules, to produce adaptations to simple chemical or energetic differences of environment without diverse solutions and without historical contingency. We demonstrate these features of metabolism at each of several levels of hierarchy, beginning with the small-molecule metabolic substrate and network architecture, continuing with cofactors and key conserved reactions, and culminating in the aggregation of multiple diverse physical and biochemical processes in cells.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome duplications ({WGDs}) have occurred repeatedly in the vertebrate lineage, but their evolutionary significance for phenotypic evolution remains elusive. Here, we have investigated the impact of the fish-specific genome duplication ({FSGD}) on the evolution of pigmentation pathways in teleost fishes. Pigmentation and color patterning are among the most diverse traits in teleosts, and their pigmentary system is the most complex of all vertebrate groups.
Using a comparative genomic approach including phylogenetic and synteny analyses, the evolution of 128 vertebrate pigmentation genes in five teleost genomes following the {FSGD} has been reconstructed. We show that pigmentation genes have been preferentially retained in duplicate after the {FSGD}, so that teleosts have 30\% more pigmentation genes compared with tetrapods. This is significantly higher than genome-wide estimates of {FSGD} gene duplicate retention in teleosts. Large parts of the melanocyte regulatory network have been retained in two copies after the {FSGD}. Duplicated pigmentation genes follow general evolutionary patterns such as the preservation of protein complex stoichiometries and the overrepresentation of developmental genes among retained duplicates. These results suggest that the {FSGD} has made an important contribution to the evolution of teleost-specific features of pigmentation, which include novel pigment cell types or the division of existing pigment cell types into distinct subtypes. Furthermore, we have observed species-specific differences in duplicate retention and evolution that might contribute to pigmentary diversity among teleosts.
Our study therefore strongly supports the hypothesis that {WGDs} have promoted the increase of complexity and diversity during vertebrate phenotypic evolution.},

Maladaptation to the new environment initially causes the population to decline, until adaptive phenotypic plasticity and genetic evolution restore positive population growth rate. We assume that selection on a quantitative trait is density-independent and that the initial cost of plasticity is much lower than the benefit of the initial plastic response. The initial partially adaptive plasticity reduces the effective magnitude of the environmental shift, whereas evolution of plasticity increases the rate of adaptation. Both effects greatly facilitate population persistence. In contrast, density dependence of population growth always hinders persistence. With θ-logistic population regulation, a lower value of θ produces a faster initial population decline and a higher extinction risk.},

To understand the changes in biochemistry and enzymology that accompanied adaptation to O2, we integrated network analysis with information on enzyme evolution to infer how oxygen availability changed the architecture of metabolic networks. Our analysis revealed the existence of four discrete groups of networks of increasing complexity, with transitions between groups being contingent on the presence of key metabolites, including molecular oxygen, which was required for transition into the largest networks.},

It has been hypothesized that the evolutionary advantages of polyploidy are context-dependent, although we have yet to clearly identify the geographical or ecological contexts in which polyploids are more common. One reason why polyploidy may be displaying idiosyncratic ecological patterns is that previous comparative studies have often not separated polyploids into allopolyploids and autopolyploids, and we posit that there may be important differences in the origin and evolutionary success between the two types. Here, we examine the distribution of allopolyploid, autopolyploid, and diploid hybrid species along an elevation gradient from sea level to ∼4500 m within British Columbia, Canada, and find that polyploids (especially those of hybrid origin) are disproportionately present at high elevations. These processes of hyb..., Bien qu'il soit bien établi que plusieurs clades possèdent de la polyploïdisation dans leur histoire évolutive, la question à savoir si la polyploïdisation est réellement adaptative demeure entière. On a formé l'hypothèse que les avantages évolutifs de la polyploïdie dépendent du contexte dans lequel les polyploïdes sont les plus communs. Une raison pour laquelle la polyploïdie montrerait des patrons écologiques idiosyncrasiques est que les études comparatives antérieures n'ont souvent pas séparé les polyploïdes en allopolyploïdes et autopolyploïdes; les auteurs soumettent qu'il pourrait y avoir des différences importantes dans l'origine et le succès évolutif entre les deux types. Ils examinent ici la distribution des allopolyploïdes, autopolyploïdes et diploïdes par espèce, le long d'un gradient d'élévation allant du niveau de la mer jusqu'à ∼4500 m en Colombie Canadienne, au Canada, et constatent que les polyploïdes (surtout d'origine hybride) montrent une présence disproportionnée aux hautes altitudes....},

As a eukaryotic model, Paramecium is well suited for genetic analysis. Taking a rather unconventional view of genetics, Paramecium: Genetics and Epigenetics explores how to use this protozoan as a basis for studying complex cells. The book discusses various aspects of Paramecium, including the cortex, the cytoplasm, nuclei, asexual fission, conjugation, autogamy,macronuclear regeneration, cytogamy, life cycle phases, and behavior. It examines the assorted mating types of the genus and how these mating types are determined. It also elucidates some techniques that identify genetically defined genes with the {DNA} from a library that comprises those genes and details the genetic, epigenetic, chemical, and molecular facets of several different traits. In addition, the authors chronicle the history and reemergence of investigating {RNA} and {DNA} in Paramecium. With many powerful tools now available, Paramecium research is entering a new frontier in molecular biology. A full account of Paramecium genetics, this book presents a wealth of time-consuming observations and remarkable phenomena that will lead to a better understanding of complex cells.},

We used Arabidopsis thaliana as an outgroup for investigating the consequences of genome triplication, such as structural and functional evolution. The extent of gene loss (fractionation) among triplicated genome segments varies, with one of the three copies consistently retaining a disproportionately large fraction of the genes expected to have been present in its ancestor. Variation in the number of members of gene families present in the genome may contribute to the remarkable morphological plasticity of Brassica species.

Since {GEMRs} are based on sequenced genomes, its applicability to organisms where genomic information is lacking is limited.

We investigated components of cyanobacterial evolution that have been vertically inherited, horizontally transferred, and donated to eukaryotes at plastid origin. The vertical component indicates a freshwater origin for water-splitting photosynthesis. Networks of the horizontal component reveal that 60\% of cyanobacterial gene families have been affected by {LGT}. Plant nuclear genes acquired from cyanobacteria define a lower bound frequency of 611 multigene families that, in turn, specify diazotrophic cyanobacterial lineages as having a gene collection most similar to that possessed by the plastid ancestor.},

	abstract = {Although ants may induce community-wide effects via changes in physical habitats in terrestrial environments, their influence on aquatic communities living in plant-held waters remains largely underexplored. The neotropical tank-bromeliad Aechmea mertensii (Bromeliaceae) occurs along forest edges in ant-gardens initiated by Camponotus femoratus or by Pachycondyla goeldii. Its leaves form wells that hold rainwater and provide suitable habitats for many aquatic organisms. We postulated that these ant–plant mutualisms indirectly affect the microbial community structure via changes in the environmental conditions experienced by the plants. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the protist communities from 63 tank-bromeliads associated with either C. femoratus or P. goeldii (hereafter Cf-Aechmea and Pg-Aechmea) along a forest edge in French Guiana. For each plant, a large number of environmental variables (including habitat structure, food resources, incident radiation and the presence of aquatic invertebrates) were quantified to determine their relative importance in driving any observed differences across ant-associated plants. Pg-Aechmea are located in sun-exposed areas and hold low volumes of water and low amounts of detritus, whereas Cf-Aechmea are located in partially shaded areas and accumulate higher amounts of water and detritus. Protists (i.e., protozoa and algae) inhabiting Cf-Aechmea exhibit greater richness and abundances than those in Pg-Aechmea. Variations in detritus content, number of leaves, incident radiation, and the epiphyte richness of the ant-garden were the main factors explaining the variation in protist richness. A shift in the functional group composition of protists between bromeliads tended by different ant species suggested that mutualistic ants indirectly mediate changes in the microbial food web.},

This landmark event conferred on eukaryotes the benefits of photosynthesis--the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy--and in so doing had a huge impact on the course of evolution and the climate of Earth 1. From the present state of plastids, however, it is difficult to trace the evolutionary steps involved in this momentous development, because all modern-day plastids have fully integrated into their hosts. Paulinella chromatophora is a unicellular eukaryote that bears photosynthetic entities called chromatophores that are derived from cyanobacteria and has thus received much attention as a possible example of an organism in the early stages of organellogenesis. Recent studies have unlocked the genomic secrets of its chromatophore 23 and provided concrete evidence that the Paulinella chromatophore is a bona fide photosynthetic organelle 4. The question is how Paulinella can help us to understand the process by which an endosymbiont is converted into an organelle.},

	abstract = {Background
Deciphering cis-regulatory networks has become an attractive yet challenging task. This paper presents a simple method for cis-regulatory network discovery which aims to avoid some of the common problems of previous approaches.

Results
Using promoter sequences and gene expression profiles as input, rather than clustering the genes by the expression data, our method utilizes co-expression neighborhood information for each individual gene, thereby overcoming the disadvantages of current clustering based models which may miss specific information for individual genes. In addition, rather than using a motif database as an input, it implements a simple motif count table for each enumerated k-mer for each gene promoter sequence. Thus, it can be used for species where previous knowledge of cis-regulatory motifs is unknown and has the potential to discover new transcription factor binding sites. Applications on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis have shown that our method has a good prediction accuracy and outperforms a phylogenetic footprinting approach. Furthermore, the top ranked gene-motif regulatory clusters are evidently functionally co-regulated, and the regulatory relationships between the motifs and the enriched biological functions can often be confirmed by literature.

Conclusions
Since this method is simple and gene-specific, it can be readily utilized for insufficiently studied species or flexibly used as an additional step or data source for previous transcription regulatory networks discovery models.},

To address this difficult question, we have sequenced 1,280 expressed sequence tags from Mastigamoeba balamuthi and assembled a large data set containing 123 genes for representatives of three phenotypically highly divergent major amoeboid lineages: Pelobionta, Entamoebidae, and Mycetozoa. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed on ≈25,000 aa positions for 30 species by using maximum-likelihood approaches. All well-established eukaryotic groups were recovered with high statistical support, validating our approach. Interestingly, the three amoeboid lineages strongly clustered together in agreement with the Conosa hypothesis [as defined by T. Cavalier-Smith (1998) Biol. Rev. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 73, 203–266]. Two amitochondriate amoebae, the free-living Mastigamoeba and the human parasite Entamoeba, formed a significant sister group to the exclusion of the mycetozoan Dictyostelium. This result suggested that a part of the reductive process in the evolution of Entamoeba (e.g., loss of typical mitochondria) occurred in its free-living ancestors. Applying this inexpensive expressed sequence tag approach to many other lineages will surely improve our understanding of eukaryotic evolution.},

Following {WGD}, some ohnologs ({WGD} paralogs) remain in the genome arranged in blocks of conserved gene order and content (paralogons). However, the most common outcome is loss of one of the ohnolog pair. It is unclear what factors, if any, govern gene loss from paralogons. Recent studies have reported physical clustering (genetic linkage) of functionally linked (interacting) genes in the human genome and propose a biological significance for the clustering of interacting genes such as coexpression or preservation of epistatic interactions. Here we conduct a novel test of a hypothesis that functionally linked genes in the same paralogon are preferentially retained in cis after {WGD}. We compare the number of protein–protein interactions ({PPIs}) between linked singletons within a paralogon (defined as cis-{PPIs}) with that of {PPIs} between singletons across paralogon pairs (defined as trans-{PPIs}). We find that paralogons in which the number of cis-{PPIs} is greater than that of trans-{PPIs} are significantly enriched in human and yeast. The trend is similar in plants, but it is difficult to assess statistical significance due to multiple, overlapping {WGD} events. Interestingly, human singletons participating in cis-{PPIs} tend to be classified into “response to stimulus.” We uncover strong evidence of biased gene loss after {WGD}, which further supports the hypothesis of biologically significant gene clusters in eukaryotic genomes. These observations give us new insight for understanding the evolution of genome structure and of protein interaction networks.},

These factors play a pivotal role in all biological processes, including the determination of a cell's fate during development and the maintenance of a cell's physiological function. To achieve this, a {TF} binds to specific {DNA} sequences in the noncoding part of the genome, recruits chromatin modifiers and cofactors, and directs the transcription initiation rate of its “target genes.” Therefore, a key challenge in deciphering a transcriptional switch is to identify the direct target genes of the master regulators that control the switch, the cis-regulatory elements implementing (auto-)regulatory loops, and the target genes of all the {TFs} in the downstream regulatory network. A better knowledge of a {TF}'s targetome during specification and differentiation of a particular cell type will generate mechanistic insight into its developmental program. Here, I review computational strategies and methods to predict transcriptional targets by genome-wide searches for {TF} binding sites using position weight matrices, motif clusters, phylogenetic footprinting, chromatin binding and accessibility data, enhancer classification, motif enrichment, and gene expression signatures.},

The flexible framework means that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent broader classes of model elements than are treated in traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all ‘unobservables’ (latent variables and parameters), and it declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability, which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically with sample size.

Methods that estimate networks or graphs have become popular tools for proposing causal relationships among traits. However, it is not obvious that these methods are able to capture causal biological mechanisms. Here we address the power and limitations of causal inference methods in biological systems. We examine metabolic data from simulation and from a well-characterized metabolic pathway in plants. We show that variation has to propagate through the pathway for reliable network inference. While it is possible for causal inference methods to recover the ordering of the biological pathway, it should not be expected. Causal relationships create subtle patterns in correlation, which may be dominated by other biological factors that do not reflect the ordering of the underlying pathway. Our results shape expectations about these methods and explain some of the successes and failures of causal graphical models for network inference.},

	abstract = {In this review we analyze the dormancy strategies of metazoans inhabiting “hostile to life” habitats, which have a strong impact on their ecology and in particular on the traits of their life history. Tardigrades are here considered a model animal, being aquatic organisms colonizing terrestrial habitats. Tardigrades evolved a large variety of dormant stages that can be ascribed to diapause (encystment, cyclomorphosis, resting eggs) and cryptobiosis (anhydrobiosis, cryobiosis, anoxibiosis). In tardigrades, diapause and cryptobiosis can occur separately or simultaneously, consequently the adoption of one adaptive strategy is not necessarily an alternative to the adoption of the other. Encystment and cyclomorphosis are characterized by seasonal cyclic changes in morphology and physiology of the animals. They share several common features and their evolution is strictly linked to the molting process. A bet-hedging strategy with different patterns of egg hatching time has been observed in a tardigrade species. Four categories of eggs have been identified: subitaneous, delayed-hatching, abortive and diapause resting eggs, which needs a stimulus to hatch (rehydration after a period of desiccation). Cryptobiotic tardigrades are able to withstand desiccation (anhydrobiosis) and freezing (cryobiosis) at any stage of their life-cycle. This ability involves a complex array of factors working at molecular (bioprotectans), physiological and structural levels. Animal survival and the accumulation of molecular damage are related to the time spent in the cryptobiotic state, to the abiotic parameters during the cryptobiotic state, and to the conditions during initial and final phases of the process. Cryptobiosis evolved independently at least two times in tardigrades, in eutardigrades and in echiniscoids. Within each evolutionary line, the absence of cryptobiotic abilities is more related to selective pressures to local habitat adaptation than to phylogenetic relationships. The selective advantages of cryptobiosis (e.g. persistency in “hostile to life” habitats, reduction of competitors, parasites and predators, escaping in time from stressful conditions) could explain the high tardigrade species diversity and number of specimens found in habitats that dry out compared to freshwater habitats.},

	abstract = {Gene and genome duplications provide a playground for various selective pressures and contribute significantly to genome complexity. It is assumed that the genomes of all major eukaryotic lineages possess duplicated regions that result from gene and genome duplication. There is evidence that the model plant Arabidopsis has been subjected to at least three whole-genome duplication events over the last 150-200 million years. As a result, many cellular processes are governed by redundantly acting gene families. Plants pass through two distinct life phases with a haploid gametophytic alternating with a diploid sporophytic generation. This ontogenetic difference in gene copy number has important implications for the outcome of deleterious mutations, which are masked by the second gene copy in diploid systems but expressed in a dominant fashion in haploid organisms. As a consequence, maintaining the activity of duplicated genes might be particularly advantageous during the haploid gametophytic generation. Here, we describe the distinctive features associated with the alteration of generations and discuss how activity profiles of duplicated genes might get modulated in a life phase dependent fashion.},

Here, we present an update on the online database resource Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes ({STRING}); it provides uniquely comprehensive coverage and ease of access to both experimental as well as predicted interaction information. Interactions in {STRING} are provided with a confidence score, and accessory information such as protein domains and 3D structures is made available, all within a stable and consistent identifier space. New features in {STRING} include an interactive network viewer that can cluster networks on demand, updated on-screen previews of structural information including homology models, extensive data updates and strongly improved connectivity and integration with third-party resources.

	abstract = {Author Summary Antimicrobial peptides ({AMPs}) are produced by the mammalian immune system to fight invading pathogens. The best understood function of {AMPs} is to interact with the membranes of microbes, thereby disrupting and killing cells. However, the amount of {AMP} available during chronic bacterial infections may not be sufficient to kill pathogens (sub-inhibitory). In this study, we found that at sub-inhibitory levels, {AMPs} promote mutations in bacterial {DNA}, a function not previously attributed to them. In particular, we found that in the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one {AMP} called {LL}-37 can promote mutations, which enable the bacteria to overproduce a protective sugar coating, a process called mucoid conversion. P. aeruginosa mucoid conversion is a major risk factor for those suffering from cystic fibrosis ({CF}), the most common lethal, heritable disease in the {US}. We found that {LL}-37 is able to produce these mutations by penetrating the bacterial cell and binding to the bacterial {DNA}. {DNA} binding disrupts normal {DNA} replication and allows mutations to occur. Furthermore, we observed {LL}-37 induced mutagenesis in processes apart from mucoid conversion, in both P. aeruginosa and E. coli. This suggests that {AMP}-induced mutagenesis may be important for a broad range of chronic diseases and pathogens.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Identification of functionally conserved regulatory elements in sequence data from closely related organisms is becoming feasible, due to the rapid growth of public sequence databases. Closely related organisms are most likely to have common regulatory motifs; however, the recent speciation of such organisms results in the high degree of correlation in their genome sequences, confounding the detection of functional elements. Additionally, alignment algorithms that use optimization techniques are limited to the detection of a single alignment that may not be representative. Comparative-genomics studies must be able to address the phylogenetic correlation in the data and efficiently explore the alignment space, in order to make specific and biologically relevant predictions.
Results: We describe here a Gibbs sampler that employs a full phylogenetic model and reports an ensemble centroid solution. We describe regulatory motif detection using both simulated and real data, and demonstrate that this approach achieves improved specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value over non-phylogenetic algorithms, and over phylogenetic algorithms that report a maximum likelihood solution.

	abstract = {Background Discovering transcription factor binding sites ({TFBS}) is one of primary challenges to decipher complex gene regulatory networks encrypted in a genome. A set of short {DNA} sequences identified by a transcription factor ({TF}) is known as a motif, which can be expressed accurately in matrix form such as a position-specific scoring matrix ({PSSM}) and a position frequency matrix. Very frequently, we need to query a motif in a database of motifs by seeking its similar motifs, merge similar {TFBS} motifs possibly identified by the same {TF}, separate irrelevant motifs, or filter out spurious motifs. Therefore, a novel metric is required to seize slight differences between irrelevant motifs and highlight the similarity between motifs of the same group in all these applications. While there are already several metrics for motif similarity proposed before, their performance is still far from satisfactory for these applications. Methods A novel metric has been proposed in this paper with name as {SPIC} (Similarity with Position Information Contents) for measuring the similarity between a column of a motif and a column of another motif. When defining this similarity score, we consider the likelihood that the column of the first motif's {PFM} can be produced by the column of the second motif's {PSSM}, and multiply the likelihood by the information content of the column of the second motif's {PSSM}, and vise versa. We evaluated the performance of {SPIC} combined with a local or a global alignment method having a function for affine gap penalty, for computing the similarity between two motifs. We also compared {SPIC} with seven existing state-of-the-arts metrics for their capability of clustering motifs from the same group and retrieving motifs from a database on three datasets. Results When used jointly with the Smith-Waterman local alignment method with an affine gap penalty function (gap open penalty is equal to1, gap extension penalty is equal to 0.5), {SPIC} outperforms the seven existing state-of-the-art motif similarity metrics combined with their best alignments for matching motifs in database searches, and clustering the same {TF}'s sub-motifs or distinguishing relevant ones from a miscellaneous group of motifs. Conclusions We have developed a novel motif similarity metric that can more accurately match motifs in database searches, and more effectively cluster similar motifs and differentiate irrelevant motifs than do the other seven metrics we are aware of.},

Studies on tolerance during embryological stages are rare, but differential effects of desiccation and freezing on different developmental stages have been reported, as well as dose-dependent effect of gamma irradiation on tardigrade embryos. Here, we report a study evaluating the tolerance of eggs from the eutardigrade Milnesium cf. tardigradum to three doses of gamma radiation (50, 200 and 500 Gy) at the early, middle, and late stage of development. We found that embryos of the middle and late developmental stages were tolerant to all doses, while eggs in the early developmental stage were tolerant only to a dose of 50 Gy, and showed a declining survival with higher dose. We also observed a delay in development of irradiated eggs, suggesting that periods of {DNA} repair might have taken place after irradiation induced damage. The delay was independent of dose for eggs irradiated in the middle and late stage, possibly indicating a fixed developmental schedule for repair after induced damage. These results show that the tolerance to radiation in tardigrade eggs changes in the course of their development. The mechanisms behind this pattern are unknown, but may relate to changes in mitotic activities over the embryogenesis and/or to activation of response mechanisms to damaged {DNA} in the course of development.},

Knowledge of the molecular basis of this phenomenon may contribute to the understanding of natural evolution of multicellularity and to manipulating cell sedimentation in laboratory and industrial applications of S. cerevisiae. Multicellular, fast-sedimenting lineages obtained from a haploid S. cerevisiae strain in two independent evolution experiments were analyzed by whole genome resequencing. The two evolved cell lines showed different frameshift mutations in a stretch of eight adenosines in {ACE}2, which encodes a transcriptional regulator involved in cell cycle control and mother-daughter cell separation. Introduction of the two ace2 mutant alleles into the haploid parental strain led to slow-sedimenting cell clusters that consisted of just a few cells, thus representing only a partial reconstruction of the evolved phenotype. In addition to single-nucleotide mutations, a whole-genome duplication event had occurred in both evolved multicellular strains. Construction of a diploid reference strain with two mutant ace2 alleles led to complete reconstruction of the multicellular-fast sedimenting phenotype. This study shows that whole-genome duplication and a frameshift mutation in {ACE}2 are sufficient to generate a fast-sedimenting, multicellular phenotype in S. cerevisiae. The nature of the ace2 mutations and their occurrence in two independent evolution experiments encompassing fewer than 500 generations of selective growth suggest that switching between unicellular and multicellular phenotypes may be relevant for competitiveness of S. cerevisiae in natural environments.},

Based on long-term studies of growing populations of birds and mammals, we analyze population dynamics by using fluctuations in the total reproductive value of the population. This enables us to account for random fluctuations in age distribution. The influence of demographic and environmental stochasticity on the population dynamics of a species decreased with generation time. Variation in age-specific contributions to total reproductive value and to stochastic components of population dynamics was correlated with the position of the species along the slow-fast continuum of life-history variation. Younger age classes relative to the generation time accounted for larger contributions to the total reproductive value and to demographic stochasticity in slow than in fast species, in which many age classes contributed more equally. In contrast, fluctuations in population growth rate attributable to stochastic environmental variation involved a larger proportion of all age classes independent of life history. Thus, changes in population growth rates can be surprisingly well explained by basic species-specific life-history characteristics.},

	abstract = {Background
Proteins evolve at disparate rates, as a result of the action of different types and strengths of evolutionary forces. An open question in evolutionary biology is what factors are responsible for this variability. In general, proteins whose function has a great impact on organisms’ fitness are expected to evolve under stronger selective pressures. In biosynthetic pathways, upstream genes usually evolve under higher levels of selective constraint than those acting at the downstream part, as a result of their higher hierarchical position. Similar observations have been made in transcriptional regulatory networks, whose upstream elements appear to be more essential and subject to selection. Less well understood is, however, how selective pressures distribute along signal transduction pathways.

Results
Here, I combine comparative genomics and directed protein interaction data to study the distribution of evolutionary forces across the human signal transduction network. Surprisingly, no evidence was found for higher levels of selective constraint at the upstream network genes (those occupying more hierarchical positions). On the contrary, purifying selection was found to act more strongly on genes acting at the downstream part of the network, which seems to be due to downstream genes being more highly and broadly expressed, performing certain functions and, in particular, encoding proteins that are more highly connected in the protein–protein interaction network. When the effect of these confounding factors is discounted, upstream and downstream genes evolve at similar rates. The trends found in the overall signaling network are exemplified by analysis of the distribution of purifying selection along the mammalian Ras signaling pathway, showing that upstream and downstream genes evolve at similar rates.

Conclusions
These results indicate that the upstream/downstream position of proteins in the signal transduction network has, in general, no direct effect on their rates of evolution, suggesting that upstream and downstream genes are similarly important for the function of the network. This implies that natural selection differently distributes across signal transduction networks and across biosynthetic and transcriptional regulatory networks, which might reflect fundamental differences in their function and organization.},

What ecological, biogeographical and genetic factors cause {WGD} to occur in nature? How does {WGD} affect gene expression? How do genomes evolve after {WGD}? New species that have arisen recently through {WGD} are good places to seek answers to such questions. These could be relatively common in nature, but reliably demonstrating their recent origin requires documentary evidence, which can be very hard to come by. Thus far, records of species introductions and meticulous botanizing have demonstrated six new natural allopolyploids in just four genera: Tragopogon miscellus and T. mirus, Senecio cambrensis and S. eboracensis, Spartina anglica and Cardamine schultzii (Abbott \& Rieseberg 2012; Ainouche et al. 2009; Soltis \& Soltis 2009). It is risky to generalize about a universal feature of plant evolution from such a small sample; more examples are needed, in different genera. It is therefore of considerable interest that Mario Vallejo-Marin of University of Stirling has this year named a new allopolyploid species of monkey flower, Mimulus peregrinus, and presented evidence that it is {\textless}140 years old (Vallejo-Marin 2012). This discovery is particularly timely as the monkey flower genus is developing rapidly as a model system for ecological genetics (Wu et al. 2008), and in the current issue of Molecular Ecology, Jennifer Modliszewski and John Willis of Duke University present new data showing high genetic diversity in another recently discovered monkey flower allopolyploid, M. sookensis (Modliszewski \& Willis 2012).},

	abstract = {Whole-genome duplication has shaped the genomes of extant lineages ranging from unicellular fungi to vertebrates, and its association with several species-rich taxa has fuelled interest in its potential as a catalyst for speciation. One well-established model for the evolution of reproductive isolation involves the reciprocal loss of redundant genes at different loci in allopatric populations. Whole-genome duplication simultaneously doubles the entire gene content of an organism, resulting in massive levels of genetic redundancy and potential for reciprocal gene loss that may produce postzygotic reproductive isolation. Following whole-genome duplication, different populations can potentially change or lose gene function at different duplicate loci. If such populations come back into contact any F1 hybrids that are formed may suffer reduced fertility as some of the gametes they produce may not carry a full complement of functional genes. This reduction in hybrid fertility will be directly proportional to the number of divergently resolved loci between the populations. In this work, we demonstrate that initially identical populations of allotetraploid yeast subjected to mutagenesis rapidly evolve postzygotic reproductive isolation, consistent with the divergent loss of function of redundant gene copies.},

	abstract = {{PhyML} is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early {PhyML} versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), {PhyML} has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in {ISI} Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around {PhyML} has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of {PhyML} is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

	abstract = {Plastids and mitochondria each arose from a single endosymbiotic event and share many similarities in how they were reduced and integrated with their host. However, the subsequent evolution of the two organelles could hardly be more different: mitochondria are a stable fixture of eukaryotic cells that are neither lost nor shuffled between lineages, whereas plastid evolution has been a complex mix of movement, loss and replacement. Molecular data from the past decade have substantially untangled this complex history, and we now know that plastids are derived from a single endosymbiotic event in the ancestor of glaucophytes, red algae and green algae (including plants). The plastids of both red algae and green algae were subsequently transferred to other lineages by secondary endosymbiosis. Green algal plastids were taken up by euglenids and chlorarachniophytes, as well as one small group of dinoflagellates. Red algae appear to have been taken up only once, giving rise to a diverse group called chromalveolates. Additional layers of complexity come from plastid loss, which has happened at least once and probably many times, and replacement. Plastid loss is difficult to prove, and cryptic, non-photosynthetic plastids are being found in many non-photosynthetic lineages. In other cases, photosynthetic lineages are now understood to have evolved from ancestors with a plastid of different origin, so an ancestral plastid has been replaced with a new one. Such replacement has taken place in several dinoflagellates (by tertiary endosymbiosis with other chromalveolates or serial secondary endosymbiosis with a green alga), and apparently also in two rhizarian lineages: chlorarachniophytes and Paulinella (which appear to have evolved from chromalveolate ancestors). The many twists and turns of plastid evolution each represent major evolutionary transitions, and each offers a glimpse into how genomes evolve and how cells integrate through gene transfers and protein trafficking.},

Eukaryotes are also known to have a higher rate of gene duplication than prokaryotes do [6, 7]. Because gene duplication is the primary source of new genes [], the average gene complexity in a genome may have been increased by gene duplication if complex genes are preferentially duplicated. Here, we test this "gene complexity and gene duplicability" hypothesis with yeast genomic data. We show that, on average, duplicate genes from either whole-genome or individual-gene duplication have longer protein sequences, more functional domains, and more cis-regulatory motifs than singleton genes. This phenomenon is not a by-product of previously known mechanisms, such as protein function [10-13], evolutionary rate [14, 15], dosage [11], and dosage balance [16], that influence gene duplicability. Rather, it appears to have resulted from the sub-neo-functionalization process in duplicate-gene evolution [11]. Under this process, complex genes are more likely to be retained after duplication because they are prone to subfunctionalization, and gene complexity is regained via subsequent neofunctionalization. Thus, gene duplication increases both gene number and gene complexity, two important factors in the origin of genomic and organismal complexity.},

	abstract = {Background
We introduce several forest-based and network-based methods for exploring microbial evolution, and apply them to the study of thousands of genes from 30 strains of E. coli. This case study illustrates how additional analyses could offer fast heuristic alternatives to standard tree of life ({TOL}) approaches.

Results
We use gene networks to identify genes with atypical modes of evolution, and genome networks to characterize the evolution of genetic partnerships between E. coli and mobile genetic elements. We develop a novel polychromatic quartet method to capture patterns of recombination within E. coli, to update the clanistic toolkit, and to search for the impact of lateral gene transfer and of pathogenicity on gene evolution in two large forests of trees bearing E. coli. We unravel high rates of lateral gene transfer involving E. coli (about 40\% of the trees under study), and show that both core genes and shell genes of E. coli are affected by non-tree-like evolutionary processes. We show that pathogenic lifestyle impacted the structure of 30\% of the gene trees, and that pathogenic strains are more likely to transfer genes with one another than with non-pathogenic strains. In addition, we propose five groups of genes as candidate mobile modules of pathogenicity. We also present strong evidence for recent lateral gene transfer between E. coli and mobile genetic elements.

Conclusions
Depending on which evolutionary questions biologists want to address (i.e. the identification of modules, genetic partnerships, recombination, lateral gene transfer, or genes with atypical evolutionary modes, etc.), forest-based and network-based methods are preferable to the reconstruction of a single tree, because they provide insights and produce hypotheses about the dynamics of genome evolution, rather than the relative branching order of species and lineages. Such a methodological pluralism - the use of woods and webs - is to be encouraged to analyse the evolutionary processes at play in microbial evolution., This manuscript was reviewed by: Ford Doolittle, Tal Pupko, Richard Burian, James {McInerney}, Didier Raoult, and Yan Boucher},

	abstract = {Whole genome duplication (leading to polyploidy) is widely accepted as an important evolutionary force in plants, but it is less recognized as a driver of animal diversification. Nevertheless, it occurs across a wide range of animals; this review investigates why it is particularly common in fish and amphibians, while rare among other vertebrates. We review the current geographic, ecological and phylogenetic distributions of sexually reproducing polyploid taxa before focusing more specifically on what factors drive polyploid formation and establishment. In summary, (1) polyploidy is phylogenetically restricted in both amphibians and fishes, although entire fish, but not amphibian, lineages are derived from polyploid ancestors. (2) Although mechanisms such as polyspermy are feasible, polyploid formation appears to occur principally through unreduced gamete formation, which can be experimentally induced by temperature or pressure shock in both groups. (3) External reproduction and fertilization in primarily temperate freshwater environments potentially exposes zygotes to temperature stress, which can promote increased production of unreduced gametes. (4) Large numbers of gametes and group breeding in relatively confined areas could increase the probability of compatible gamete combinations in both groups. (5) Both fish and amphibians have a propensity to form reproductively successful hybrids; although the relative frequency of autopolyploidy versus allopolyploidy is difficult to ascertain, multiple origins involving hybridization have been confirmed for a number of species in both groups. (6) Problems with establishment of polyploid lineages associated with minority cytotype exclusion could be overcome in amphibians via assortative mating by acoustic recognition of the same ploidy level, but less attention has been given to chemical or acoustic mechanisms that might operate in fish. (7) There is no strong evidence that polyploid fish or amphibians currently exist in more extreme environments than their diploid progenitors or have broader ecological ranges. (8) Although pathogens could play a role in the relative fitness of polyploid species, particularly given duplication of genes involved in immunity, this remains an understudied field in both fish and amphibians. (9) As in plants, many duplicate copies of genes are retained for long periods of time, indicative of selective maintenance of the duplicate copies, but we find no physiological or other reasons that could explain an advantage for allelic or genetic complexity. (10) Extant polyploid species do not appear to be more or less prone to extinction than related diploids in either group. We conclude that, while polyploid fish and amphibians share a number of attributes facilitating polyploidy, clear drivers of genome duplication do not emerge from the comparison. The lack of a clear association of sexually reproducing polyploids with range expansion, harsh environments, or risk of extinction could suggest that stronger correlations in plants may be driven by shifts in mating system more than ploidy. However, insufficient data currently exist to provide rigorous tests of these hypotheses and we make a plea for zoologists to also consider polyploidy as a possibility in continuing taxonomic surveys.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary and ecological factors that explain natural variation in ploidy level remain poorly understood. One intriguing possibility is that nutrient costs associated with higher per-cell nucleic acid content could differentially influence the fitness of different ploidy levels. Here, we test this hypothesis by determining whether access to phosphorus (P), a main component of nucleic acids, differentially affects growth rate in asexual freshwater snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) that differ in ploidy. As expected if larger genomes generate higher dietary P requirements, tetraploid P. antipodarum experienced a more than twofold greater reduction in growth rate in low-P versus high-P conditions relative to triploids. Mirroring these results, tetraploid P. antipodarum also had a significant reduction in body P content under low P relative to high P, whereas triploid body P content was unaffected. Taken together, these results set the stage for the possibility that P availability could influence the distribution and relative frequency of P. antipodarum of different ploidy levels. These findings could be applicable to many other animal taxa featuring ploidy-level variation, which includes many mixed sexual/asexual taxa.},

	abstract = {Reproductive males face a trade-off between expenditure on precopulatory male–male competition—increasing the number of females that they secure as mates—and sperm competition—increasing their fertilization success with those females. Previous sperm allocation models have focused on scramble competition in which males compete by searching for mates and the number of matings rises linearly with precopulatory expenditure. However, recent studies have emphasized contest competition involving precopulatory expenditure on armaments, where winning contests may be highly dependent on marginal increases in relative armament level. Here, we develop a general model of sperm allocation that allows us to examine the effect of all forms of precopulatory competition on sperm allocation patterns. The model predicts that sperm allocation decreases if either the “mate-competition loading,”a, or the number of males competing for each mating, M, increases. Other predictions remain unchanged from previous models: (i) expenditure per ejaculate should increase and then decrease, and (ii) total postcopulatory expenditure should increase, as the level of sperm competition increases. A negative correlation between a and M is biologically plausible, and may buffer deviations from the previous models. There is some support for our predictions from comparative analyses across dung beetle species and frog populations.},

* Here, we use a quantitative genetic model of adaptation by additive genetic variance, within- and transgenerational plasticity via linear reaction norms and indirect genetic effects respectively.


* We show how the relative influence on the eventual phenotype of these components depends on the predictability of environmental change (fast or slow, sinusoidal or stochastic) and the developmental lag τ between when the environment is perceived and when selection acts.


* We then decompose expected mean fitness into three components (variance load, adaptation and fluctuation load) to study the fitness costs of within- and transgenerational plasticity. A strongly negative maternal effect coefficient m minimizes the variance load, but a strongly positive m minimises the fluctuation load. The adaptation term is maximized closer to zero, with positive or negative m preferred under different environmental scenarios.


* Phenotypic plasticity is higher when τ is shorter and when the environment changes frequently between seasonal extremes. Expected mean population fitness is highest away from highest observed levels of phenotypic plasticity.


* Within- and transgenerational plasticity act in concert to deliver well-adapted phenotypes, which emphasizes the need to study both simultaneously when investigating phenotypic evolution.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive genome-scale metabolic network of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, including a detailed account of light-driven metabolism, is reconstructed and validated. The model provides a new resource for research of C. reinhardtii metabolism and in algal biotechnology., 
          
            
              The genome-scale metabolic network of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ({iRC}1080) was reconstructed, accounting for {\textgreater}32\% of the estimated metabolic genes encoded in the genome, and including extensive details of lipid metabolic pathways.
            
            
              This is the first metabolic network to explicitly account for stoichiometry and wavelengths of metabolic photon usage, providing a new resource for research of C. reinhardtii metabolism and developments in algal biotechnology.
            
            
              Metabolic functional annotation and the largest transcript verification of a metabolic network to date was performed, at least partially verifying {\textgreater}90\% of the transcripts accounted for in {iRC}1080. Analysis of the network supports hypotheses concerning the evolution of latent lipid pathways in C. reinhardtii, including very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid and ceramide synthesis pathways.
            
            
              A novel approach for modeling light-driven metabolism was developed that accounts for both light source intensity and spectral quality of emitted light. The constructs resulting from this approach, termed prism reactions, were shown to significantly improve the accuracy of model predictions, and their use was demonstrated for evaluation of light source efficiency and design.
            
          
        , Algae have garnered significant interest in recent years, especially for their potential application in biofuel production. The hallmark, model eukaryotic microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been widely used to study photosynthesis, cell motility and phototaxis, cell wall biogenesis, and other fundamental cellular processes (). Characterizing algal metabolism is key to engineering production strains and understanding photobiological phenomena. Based on extensive literature on C. reinhardtii metabolism, its genome sequence (), and gene functional annotation, we have reconstructed and experimentally validated the genome-scale metabolic network for this alga, {iRC}1080, the first network to account for detailed photon absorption permitting growth simulations under different light sources. {iRC}1080 accounts for 1080 genes, associated with 2190 reactions and 1068 unique metabolites and encompasses 83 subsystems distributed across 10 cellular compartments (). Its {\textgreater}32\% coverage of estimated metabolic genes is a tremendous expansion over previous algal reconstructions (; ). The lipid metabolic pathways of {iRC}1080 are considerably expanded relative to existing networks, and chemical properties of all metabolites in these pathways are accounted for explicitly, providing sufficient detail to completely specify all individual molecular species: backbone molecule and stereochemical numbering of acyl-chain positions; acyl-chain length; and number, position, and cis–trans stereoisomerism of carbon–carbon double bonds. Such detail in lipid metabolism will be critical for model-driven metabolic engineering efforts., We experimentally verified transcripts accounted for in the network under permissive growth conditions, detecting {\textgreater}90\% of tested transcript models () and providing validating evidence for the contents of {iRC}1080. We also analyzed the extent of transcript verification by specific metabolic subsystems. Some subsystems stood out as more poorly verified, including chloroplast and mitochondrial transport systems and sphingolipid metabolism, all of which exhibited {\textless}80\% of transcripts detected, reflecting incomplete characterization of compartmental transporters and supporting a hypothesis of latent pathway evolution for ceramide synthesis in C. reinhardtii. Additional lines of evidence from the reconstruction effort similarly support this hypothesis including lack of ceramide synthetase and other annotation gaps downstream in sphingolipid metabolism. A similar hypothesis of latent pathway evolution was established for very long-chain fatty acids ({VLCFAs}) and their polyunsaturated analogs ({VLCPUFAs}) (), owing to the absence of this class of lipids in previous experimental measurements, lack of a candidate {VLCFA} elongase in the functional annotation, and additional downstream annotation gaps in arachidonic acid metabolism., The network provides a detailed account of metabolic photon absorption by light-driven reactions, including photosystems I and {II}, light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, provitamin D3 photoconversion to vitamin D3, and rhodopsin photoisomerase; this network accounting permits the precise modeling of light-dependent metabolism. {iRC}1080 accounts for effective light spectral ranges through analysis of biochemical activity spectra (), either reaction activity or absorbance at varying light wavelengths. Defining effective spectral ranges associated with each photon-utilizing reaction enabled our network to model growth under different light sources via stoichiometric representation of the spectral composition of emitted light, termed prism reactions. Coefficients for different photon wavelengths in a prism reaction correspond to the ratios of photon flux in the defined effective spectral ranges to the total emitted photon flux from a given light source (). This approach distinguishes the amount of emitted photons that drive different metabolic reactions. We created prism reactions for most light sources that have been used in published studies for algal and plant growth including solar light, various light bulbs, and {LEDs}. We also included regulatory effects, resulting from lighting conditions insofar as published studies enabled. Light and dark conditions have been shown to affect metabolic enzyme activity in C. reinhardtii on multiple levels: transcriptional regulation, chloroplast {RNA} degradation, translational regulation, and thioredoxin-mediated enzyme regulation. Through application of our light model and prism reactions, we were able to closely recapitulate experimental growth measurements under solar, incandescent, and red {LED} lights. Through unbiased sampling, we were able to establish the tremendous statistical significance of the accuracy of growth predictions achievable through implementation of prism reactions. Finally, application of the photosynthetic model was demonstrated prospectively to evaluate light utilization efficiency under different light sources. The results suggest that, of the existing light sources, red {LEDs} provide the greatest efficiency, about three times as efficient as sunlight. Extending this analysis, the model was applied to design a maximally efficient {LED} spectrum for algal growth. The result was a 677-nm peak {LED} spectrum with a total incident photon flux of 360 μE/m2/s, suggesting that for the simple objective of maximizing growth efficiency, {LED} technology has already reached an effective theoretical optimum., In summary, the C. reinhardtii metabolic network {iRC}1080 that we have reconstructed offers insight into the basic biology of this species and may be employed prospectively for genetic engineering design and light source design relevant to algal biotechnology. {iRC}1080 was used to analyze lipid metabolism and generate novel hypotheses about the evolution of latent pathways. The predictive capacity of metabolic models developed from {iRC}1080 was demonstrated in simulating mutant phenotypes and in evaluation of light source efficiency. Our network provides a broad knowledgebase of the biochemistry and genomics underlying global metabolism of a photoautotroph, and our modeling approach for light-driven metabolism exemplifies how integration of largely unvisited data types, such as physicochemical environmental parameters, can expand the diversity of applications of metabolic networks., Metabolic network reconstruction encompasses existing knowledge about an organism's metabolism and genome annotation, providing a platform for omics data analysis and phenotype prediction. The model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is employed to study diverse biological processes from photosynthesis to phototaxis. Recent heightened interest in this species results from an international movement to develop algal biofuels. Integrating biological and optical data, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic network for this alga and devised a novel light-modeling approach that enables quantitative growth prediction for a given light source, resolving wavelength and photon flux. We experimentally verified transcripts accounted for in the network and physiologically validated model function through simulation and generation of new experimental growth data, providing high confidence in network contents and predictive applications. The network offers insight into algal metabolism and potential for genetic engineering and efficient light source design, a pioneering resource for studying light-driven metabolism and quantitative systems biology.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive study on the composition, structure and diversity of tardigrade communities along the Southern Apulian coast was carried out in March and September 2000. The Apulian coastline counts about 820 km and includes a wide variety of natural environments such as Torre Guaceto, Laghi Alimini and Porto Cesareo and areas with high human impact such as Mattarelle (Enel power Station), Brindisi Harbour and Torre Mozza with its fish processing industry. The research was carried out only in the subtidal zone but in different kinds of sediments: coarse, medium, fine and very fine sand, sand in Posidonia meadows, coarse organogenous debris and mud. Seventeen stations were sampled at three different depths in two seasons: March and September, resulting in 86 samples of which 58 samples contained tardigrades. A total of 4288 specimens (2975 in March and 1313 in September) were identified to 52 species (51 in March and 36 in September). The tardigrade fauna along the Apulian coast are very rich, hosting more than 1/3 of all known arthrotardigrade species. The species found in Southern Italy belong to the arthrotardigrade families Neoarctidae (one species), Stygarctidae (four species), Halechiniscidae (42 species) and Batillipedidae (six species). Halechiniscidae is the most abundant family followed by Batillipedidae, Stygarctidae and Neoarctidae. The diversity, density and relative abundance were recorded, and the spatial variation of species diversity was statistically evaluated. Coarse sand which is found mainly at 10 m depth seems to constitute the most favourable environment, which is evident from both species number and Shannon index H. Bray–Curtis cluster analysis combined with ordination by principal component analysis discriminate the species composition in three evident main clusters: coarse sand, fine sand and mud. Furthermore, the particular environmental factors in areas with sulphur springs, mussel farms as well as high seasonal tourism, seem to have a considerable impact on the species composition of these areas.},

	abstract = {Whole genome duplication leads to autopolyploidy and brings about an increase in cell size, concentration of secondary metabolites and enhanced cytosine methylation. The increased cell size offers a positive advantage to polyploids for cell-surface-related activities, but there is a differential response to change in body size across species and taxonomic groups. Although polyploidy has been very extensively studied, having genetic, ecological and evolutionary implications, there is no report that underscores the significance of native secondary metabolites vis-à-vis body size with ploidy change. To address this problem we targeted unique diploid–autotetraploid paired sets of eight diverse clones of six species of Cymbopogon– a species complex of aromatic grasses that accumulate qualitatively different monoterpene essential oils (secondary metabolite) in their vegetative biomass. Based on the qualitative composition of essential oils and the plant body size relationship between the diploid versus autotetraploid paired sets, we show that polyploidy brings about enhanced accumulation of secondary metabolites in all cases, but exerts differential effects on body size in various species. It is observed that the accumulation of alcohol-type metabolites (e.g. geraniol) does not inhibit increase in body size with ploidy change from 2× to 4× (r = 0.854, P {\textless} 0.01), but aldehyde-type metabolites (e.g. citral) appear to drastically impede body development (r = −0.895). Such a differential response may be correlated to the metabolic steps involved in the synthesis of essential oil components. When changed to tetraploidy, the progenitor diploids requiring longer metabolic steps in production of their secondary metabolites are stressed, and those having shorter metabolite routes better utilize their resources for growth and vigour. In situ immunodetection of 5-methylcytosine sites reveals enhanced {DNA} methylation in autopolyploids. It is underpinned that the qualitative composition of secondary metabolites found in the vegetative biomass of the progenitor diploid has a decisive bearing on the body size of the derived autotetraploids and brings about an enhancement in genome-wide cytosine methylation.},

By mapping the contrasting results of population growth rate, size, and structure to the assumptions of these four models, the combined and isolated effect of density dependence and patch dynamics is quantified. The models were applied to Cecropia obtusifolia, a tropical pioneer tree species, for which field evidence on gap and density dependence is presented Models' parameters were estimated from new, 7-yr population data at Los Tuxtlas and published forest dynamics data The C. obtusifolia population at Los Tuxtlas suffers negative density-dependent regulation in fecundity and adult survival that significantly affects population structure. Its growth rate and size are strongly affected by the gap dynamics regime. The population is sensitive to the quality as well as the quantity of disturbances.

	abstract = {The role of density dependence in the population dynamics of tropical trees has been a subject of considerable debate. Here, we present data on the demography of the edible palm Euterpe edulis, classified into seven size categories and monitored over three years. On average, each adult palm contributed 98 seedling recruits per year into the population. The pattern of mortality was similar to that of other palms, with mortality being highest among the smallest plants. Those plants with a diameter at soil level {\textgreater}20 mm had an annual mortality {\textless}7\%. Density dependence was found to act only on the seedling stage of the life cycle. The probability of survival and transition of seedlings to the next size class were affected both by the density of seedlings and the presence of conspecific adults. Matrix modeling indicated that the true finite rate of population increase (λ) was 1.28 and that the observed reverse “J”-shaped size distribution of plants was a consequence of the density dependence operating in the population. Elasticity analysis showed that the survival elements in the matrix contributed most to the value of λ, and that the position of the transition matrix in growth–survival–fecundity (G–L–F) space was influenced by density. The matrix model incorporating density dependence predicted size distributions and densities approximating the maximum observed in the field. Spatial simulations indicated that the predictions from the matrix model relating to the size structure of plants are robust, but that the predictions of densities are sensitive to the precise spatial dynamics of the population.},

Successive endosymbiotic events contributed to their flexible metabolism, making them competitive in variable aquatic habitats. Although the recently sequenced genomes of the model diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana have provided the first insights into their metabolic organization, the current knowledge on diatom biochemistry remains fragmentary. By means of a genome-wide approach, we developed {DiatomCyc}, a detailed pathway/genome database of P. tricornutum. {DiatomCyc} contains 286 pathways with 1719 metabolic reactions and 1613 assigned enzymes, spanning both the central and parts of the secondary metabolism of P. tricornutum. Central metabolic pathways, such as those of carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids, were covered. Furthermore, our understanding of the carbohydrate model in P. tricornutum was extended. In particular we highlight the discovery of a functional Entner–Doudoroff pathway, an ancient alternative for the glycolytic Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway, and a putative phosphoketolase pathway, both uncommon in eukaryotes. {DiatomCyc} is accessible online (http://www.diatomcyc.org), and offers a range of software tools for the visualization and analysis of metabolic networks and ‘omics’ data. We anticipate that {DiatomCyc} will be key to gaining further understanding of diatom metabolism and, ultimately, will feed metabolic engineering strategies for the industrial valorization of diatoms.},

	abstract = {A major question in ecology is how age-specific variation in demographic parameters influences population dynamics. Based on long-term studies of growing populations of birds and mammals, we analyze population dynamics by using fluctuations in the total reproductive value of the population. This enables us to account for random fluctuations in age distribution. The influence of demographic and environmental stochasticity on the population dynamics of a species decreased with generation time. Variation in age-specific contributions to total reproductive value and to stochastic components of population dynamics was correlated with the position of the species along the slow-fast continuum of life-history variation. Younger age classes relative to the generation time accounted for larger contributions to the total reproductive value and to demographic stochasticity in slow than in fast species, in which many age classes contributed more equally. In contrast, fluctuations in population growth rate attributable to stochastic environmental variation involved a larger proportion of all age classes independent of life history. Thus, changes in population growth rates can be surprisingly well explained by basic species-specific life-history characteristics.},

	abstract = {A core promoter is a stretch of {DNA} surrounding the transcription start site ({TSS}) that integrates regulatory inputs and recruits general transcription factors to initiate transcription. The nature and causative relationship of the {DNA} sequence and chromatin signals that govern the selection of most {TSSs} by {RNA} polymerase {II} remain unresolved. Maternal to zygotic transition represents the most marked change of the transcriptome repertoire in the vertebrate life cycle. Early embryonic development in zebrafish is characterized by a series of transcriptionally silent cell cycles regulated by inherited maternal gene products: zygotic genome activation commences at the tenth cell cycle, marking the mid-blastula transition. This transition provides a unique opportunity to study the rules of {TSS} selection and the hierarchy of events linking transcription initiation with key chromatin modifications. We analysed {TSS} usage during zebrafish early embryonic development at high resolution using cap analysis of gene expression, and determined the positions of H3K4me3-marked promoter-associated nucleosomes. Here we show that the transition from the maternal to zygotic transcriptome is characterized by a switch between two fundamentally different modes of defining transcription initiation, which drive the dynamic change of {TSS} usage and promoter shape. A maternal-specific {TSS} selection, which requires an A/T-rich (W-box) motif, is replaced with a zygotic {TSS} selection grammar characterized by broader patterns of dinucleotide enrichments, precisely aligned with the first downstream (+1) nucleosome. The developmental dynamics of the H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes reveal their {DNA}-sequence-associated positioning at promoters before zygotic transcription and subsequent transcription-independent adjustment to the final position downstream of the zygotic {TSS}. The two {TSS}-defining grammars coexist, often physically overlapping, in core promoters of constitutively expressed genes to enable their expression in the two regulatory environments. The dissection of overlapping core promoter determinants represents a framework for future studies of promoter structure and function across different regulatory contexts.},

	abstract = {Whole genome duplications ({WGDs}) are considered to have been a driving force in the generation of evolutionary diversity that is characteristic of higher eukaryotes. The ancestor of salmonids underwent two additional {WGDs} compared to mammals, one (3R) at the base of the teleost radiation and another (4R) in the common ancestor of extant salmonids. We have chosen the fatty acid binding protein (fabp) gene family as a model to study the fate of duplicated genes in teleosts following {WGDs}. As previously described for zebrafish, we identified two copies (fabp7a and fabp7b) of the brain-type fabp gene in several fish including rainbow smelt, but there was only a single transcript in northern pike, the closest relative of the salmonids, and two rather than the expected four fabp7 genes in Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and grayling. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that a loss of the fabp7a gene occurred in the common ancestor of the northern pike and salmonids after it had diverged from the rainbow smelt, and that the 4R {WGD} then gave rise to the fabp7bI and fabp7bII observed in salmonids. This is supported by genetic mapping that placed the Atlantic salmon duplicated fabp7b genes on homeologous chromosomes. There was no evidence of neo-functionalization in the salmonid fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes based on {dN}/{dS} ratios and an examination of amino acid substitutions. Atlantic salmon fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes are both expressed broadly like fabp7b expression in northern pike. However, only Atlantic salmon fabp7bII, like its counterpart in northern pike and zebrafish, was expressed in the liver. A comparison of {\textasciitilde} 2000 bp upstream of Atlantic salmon fabp7b gene duplicates revealed an insertion of 62 bp in fabp7bI relative to fabp7bII. The presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in this insertion sequence may explain the differential expression of the fabp7b gene duplicates in Atlantic salmon liver.},

We measured proteome oxidation (i.e., protein carbonylation, {PC}) in D. radiodurans as well as in standard and evolved resistant strains of Escherichia coli exposed to ionizing radiation or {UVC} light and found a consistent correlation with cell killing. The unique quantitative relationship between incurred {PC} and cell death holds over the entire range of killing for all tested bacteria and for both lethal agents, meaning that both bacterial species are equally sensitive to {PC}. We show that the extraordinary robustness of D. radiodurans depends on efficient proteome protection (but not {DNA} protection) against constitutive and radiation-induced {PC} consisting of low molecular weight cytosolic compounds. Remarkably, experimental evolution of resistance to ionizing radiation in E. coli coevolves with protection against {PC}. The decline in biosynthetic efficacy of the cellular proteome, as measured by the loss of reproduction of undamaged bacteriophage λ in irradiated standard and evolved ionizing radiation-resistant E. coli, correlates with radiation-induced oxidative damage to host cells and their sensitivity to ionizing radiation. This correlation suggests that cell death by radiation is caused primarily by oxidative damage with consequential loss of maintenance activities including {DNA} repair.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryGene} duplication involves the doubling of a gene, originating an identical gene copy. Early evolutionary theory predicted that, as one gene copy is performing the ancestral function, the other gene copy, devoid from strong selection constraints, could evolve exploring alternative functions. Because of its potential to generate novel functions, hence biological complexity, gene duplication has been credited with enormous evolutionary importance. The way in which duplicated genes acquire novel functions remains the focus of intense research. Does the mechanism of duplication—duplication of small genome regions versus genome duplication—influence the fate of duplicates? Although it has been shown that the mechanism of duplication determines the persistence of genes in duplicate, a model describing the functional fates of duplicates generated by whole-genome or small-scale duplications remains largely obscure. Here we show that despite the large amount of genetic material originated by whole-genome duplication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these duplicates specialized in subsets of ancestral functions. Conversely, small-scale duplicates originated novel functions. We describe and test a model to explain the evolutionary dynamics of duplicates originated by different mechanisms. Our results shed light on the functional fates of duplicates and role of the duplication mechanism in generating functional diversity.},

Models examining this generally describe movement as a series of straight steps interspaced by turns, and implicitly assume no turn costs. We used both empirical- and modelling-based approaches to show that the energetic costs for turns in both terrestrial and aerial locomotion are substantial, which calls into question the value of conventional movement models such as correlated random walk or Lévy walk for assessing optimum path types. We show how, because straight-line travel is energetically most efficient, search strategies should favour constrained turn angles, with uninformed foragers continuing in straight lines unless the potential benefits of turning offset the cost.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome duplication ({WGD}) was experienced twice by the vertebrate ancestor (2 rounds; 2R), again by the teleost fish ancestor (3R) and most recently in certain teleost lineages (4R). Consequently, vertebrate gene families are often expanded in 3R and 4R genomes. Arguably, many types of “functional divergence” present across 2R gene families will exceed that between 3R/4R paralogs of genes comprising 2R families. Accordingly, 4R offers a form of replication of 2R. Examining whether this concept has implications for molecular evolutionary research, we studied insulin-like growth factor ({IGF}) binding proteins ({IGFBPs}), whose six 2R family members carry {IGF} hormones and regulate interactions between {IGFs} and {IGF}1-receptors ({IGF}1Rs). Using phylogenomic approaches, we resolved the complete {IGFBP} repertoire of 4R-derived salmonid fishes (19 genes; 13 more than human) and established evolutionary relationships/nomenclature with respect to {WGDs}. Traits central to {IGFBP} action were determined for all genes, including atomic interactions in {IGFBP}–{IGF}1/{IGF}2 complexes regulating {IGF}–{IGF}1R binding. Using statistical methods, we demonstrate that attributes of these protein interfaces are overwhelming a product of 2R {IGFBP} family membership, explain 49–68\% of variation in {IGFBP} {mRNA} concentration in several different tissues, and strongly predict the strength and direction of {IGFBP} transcriptional regulation under differing nutritional states. The results support a model where vertebrate {IGFBP} family members evolved divergent structural attributes to provide distinct competition for {IGFs} with {IGF}1Rs, predisposing different functions in the regulation of {IGF} signaling. Evolution of gene expression then acted to ensure the appropriate physiological production of {IGFBPs} according to their structural specializations, leading to optimal {IGF}-signaling according to nutritional-status and the endocrine/local mode of action. This study demonstrates that relatively recent gene family expansion can facilitate inference of functional evolution within ancient genetic systems.},

	abstract = {Background
Tardigrades are small, multicellular invertebrates which are able to survive
                        times of unfavourable environmental conditions using their well-known
                        capability to undergo cryptobiosis at any stage of their life cycle.
                            Milnesium tardigradum has become a powerful model
                        system for the analysis of cryptobiosis. While some genetic information is
                        already available for Milnesium tardigradum the proteome is
                        still to be discovered.

Principal Findings
Here we present to the best of our knowledge the first comprehensive study of
                            Milnesium tardigradum on the protein level. To
                        establish a proteome reference map we developed optimized protocols for
                        protein extraction from tardigrades in the active state and for separation
                        of proteins by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Since
                        only limited sequence information of M. tardigradum on the
                        genome and gene expression level is available to date in public databases we
                        initiated in parallel a tardigrade {EST} sequencing project to allow for
                        protein identification by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
                        271 out of 606 analyzed protein spots could be identified by searching
                        against the publicly available {NCBInr} database as well as our newly
                        established tardigrade protein database corresponding to 144 unique
                        proteins. Another 150 spots could be identified in the tardigrade clustered
                        {EST} database corresponding to 36 unique contigs and {ESTs}. Proteins with
                        annotated function were further categorized in more detail by their
                        molecular function, biological process and cellular component. For the
                        proteins of unknown function more information could be obtained by
                        performing a protein domain annotation analysis. Our results include
                        proteins like protein member of different heat shock protein families and
                        {LEA} group 3, which might play important roles in surviving extreme
                        conditions.

Conclusions
The proteome reference map of Milnesium tardigradum provides
                        the basis for further studies in order to identify and characterize the
                        biochemical mechanisms of tolerance to extreme desiccation. The optimized
                        proteomics workflow will enable application of sensitive quantification
                        techniques to detect differences in protein expression, which are
                        characteristic of the active and anhydrobiotic states of tardigrades.},

For instance, what rules govern the preservation or loss of the duplicated genes created by {WGD}? We explore this question by contrasting two possible preservation forces: selection on relative and absolute gene dosages. Constraints on the relative dosages of central network genes represent an important force for maintaining duplicates (the dosage balance hypothesis). However, preservation may also result from selection on the absolute abundance of certain gene products. The metabolic network of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a powerful system for comparing these hypotheses. We analyzed the surviving {WGD}-produced duplicate genes in this network, finding evidence that the surviving duplicates from the most recent {WGD} ({WGD}-α) are clustered in the network, as predicted by the dosage balance hypothesis. A flux balance analysis suggests an association between the survival of duplicates from a more ancient {WGD} ({WGD}-β) and reactions with high metabolic flux. We argue for an interplay of relative and absolute dosage constraints, such that the relative constraints imposed by the recent {WGD} are still being resolved by evolution, while they have been essentially fully resolved for the ancient event.},

We show how these two types of stochasticity affect the evolution of multivariate quantitative characters by defining demographic and environmental variances as components of individual fitness. The exact covariance formula for selection is decomposed into three components, the deterministic mean value, as well as stochastic demographic and environmental components. We show that demographic and environmental stochasticity generate random genetic drift and fluctuating selection, respectively. This provides a common theoretical framework for linking ecological and evolutionary processes. Demographic stochasticity can cause random variation in selection differentials independent of fluctuating selection caused by environmental variation. We use this model of selection to illustrate that the effect on the expected selection differential of random variation in individual fitness is dependent on population size, and that the strength of fluctuating selection is affected by how environmental variation affects the covariance in Malthusian fitness between individuals with different phenotypes. Thus, our approach enables us to partition out the effects of fluctuating selection from the effects of selection due to random variation in individual fitness caused by demographic stochasticity.},

	abstract = {It has been hypothesized that two successive rounds of whole-genome duplication ({WGD}) in the stem lineage of vertebrates provided genetic raw materials for the evolutionary innovation of many vertebrate-specific features. However, it has seldom been possible to trace such innovations to specific functional differences between paralogous gene products that derive from a {WGD} event. Here, we report genomic evidence for a direct link between {WGD} and key physiological innovations in the vertebrate oxygen transport system. Specifically, we demonstrate that key globin proteins that evolved specialized functions in different aspects of oxidative metabolism (hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytoglobin) represent paralogous products of two {WGD} events in the vertebrate common ancestor. Analysis of conserved macrosynteny between the genomes of vertebrates and amphioxus (subphylum Cephalochordata) revealed that homologous chromosomal segments defined by myoglobin + globin-E, cytoglobin, and the α-globin gene cluster each descend from the same linkage group in the reconstructed proto-karyotype of the chordate common ancestor. The physiological division of labor between the oxygen transport function of hemoglobin and the oxygen storage function of myoglobin played a pivotal role in the evolution of aerobic energy metabolism, supporting the hypothesis that {WGDs} helped fuel key innovations in vertebrate evolution.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Duplication and divergence of genes and genetic networks is hypothesized to be a major driver of the evolution of complexity and novel features. Here, we examine the history of genes and genetic networks in the context of eye evolution by using new approaches to understand patterns of gene duplication during the evolution of metazoan genomes. We hypothesize that 1) genes involved in eye development and phototransduction have duplicated and are retained at higher rates in animal clades that possess more distinct types of optical design; and 2) genes with functional relationships were duplicated and lost together, thereby preserving genetic networks. To test these hypotheses, we examine the rates and patterns of gene duplication and loss evident in 19 metazoan genomes, including that of Daphnia pulex - the first completely sequenced crustacean genome. This is of particular interest because the pancrustaceans (hexapods+crustaceans) have more optical designs than any other major clade of animals, allowing us to test specifically whether the high amount of disparity in pancrustacean eyes is correlated with a higher rate of duplication and retention of vision genes.
{RESULTS}: Using protein predictions from 19 metazoan whole-genome projects, we found all members of 23 gene families known to be involved in eye development or phototransduction and deduced their phylogenetic relationships. This allowed us to estimate the number and timing of gene duplication and loss events in these gene families during animal evolution. When comparing duplication/retention rates of these genes, we found that the rate was significantly higher in pancrustaceans than in either vertebrates or non-pancrustacean protostomes. Comparing patterns of co-duplication across Metazoa showed that while these eye-genes co-duplicate at a significantly higher rate than those within a randomly shuffled matrix, many genes with known functional relationships in model organisms did not co-duplicate more often than expected by chance.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Overall, and when accounting for factors such as differential rates of whole-genome duplication in different groups, our results are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that genes involved in eye development and phototransduction duplicate at a higher rate in Pancrustacea, the group with the greatest variety of optical designs. The result that these genes have a significantly high number of co-duplications and co-losses could be influenced by shared functions or other unstudied factors such as synteny. Since we did not observe co-duplication/co-loss of genes for all known functional modules (e.g. specific regulatory networks), the interactions among suites of known co-functioning genes (modules) may be plastic at the temporal scale of analysis performed here. Other factors in addition to gene duplication - such as cis-regulation, heterotopy, and co-option - are also likely to be strong factors in the diversification of eye types.},

In the present study, we investigate mechanisms of survival and physiological adaptations associated with sub-zero temperatures and severe osmotic stress in two commonly found cyclomorphic stages of the marine eutardigrade Halobiotus crispae. Our results show that only animals in the so-called pseudosimplex 1 stage are freeze tolerant. In pseudosimplex 1, as well as active-stage animals kept at a salinity of 20 ppt, ice formation proceeds rapidly at a crystallization temperature of around –20°C, revealing extensive supercooling in both stages, while excluding the presence of physiologically relevant ice-nucleating agents. Experiments on osmotic stress tolerance show that the active stage tolerates the largest range of salinities. Changes in body volume and hemolymph osmolality of active-stage specimens (350–500 μm) were measured following salinity transfers from 20 ppt. Hemolymph osmolality at 20 ppt was approximately 950 {mOsm} kg–1. Exposure to hypo-osmotic stress in 2 and 10 ppt caused (1) rapid swelling followed by a regulatory volume decrease, with body volume reaching control levels after 48 h and (2) decrease in hemolymph osmolality followed by a stabilization at significantly lower osmolalities. Exposure to hyperosmotic stress in 40 ppt caused (1) rapid volume reduction, followed by a regulatory increase, but with a new steady-state after 24 h below control values and (2) significant increase in hemolymph osmolality. At any investigated external salinity, active-stage H. crispae hyper-regulate, indicating a high water turnover and excretion of dilute urine. This is likely a general feature of eutardigrades.},

Like visual cues, floral electric fields exhibit variations in pattern and structure, which can be discriminated by bumblebees. We also show that such electric field information contributes to the complex array of floral cues that together improve a pollinator's memory of floral rewards. Because floral electric fields can change within seconds, this sensory modality may facilitate rapid and dynamic communication between flowers and their pollinators.},

Subsequent studies of gene expression in ploidy and aneuploidy series showed a greater number of modulations in aneuploid plants than with whole genome changes leading to the idea that gene expression processes were modulated by stoichiometric changes of interacting regulatory factors. Recent studies of genomic sequences and copy number variants in populations reveal different fates of duplicate genes depending on whole genome or segmental duplication. Following polyploidy formation, members of macromolecular complexes persist in the evolutionary lineage longer than random genes and a complementary pattern is found for segmental duplications in that there is an underrepresentation of members of macromolecular complexes. These and other studies described suggest there are negative fitness consequences when an imbalance occurs for members of macromolecular complexes including regulatory functions.},

A key question is how the rate of this micro-evolutionary change compares with the rate of environmental change, given that theoretically there is a ‘critical rate of environmental change’ beyond which increased maladaptation leads to population extinction. Here, we parametrize two closely related models to predict this critical rate using data from a long-term study of great tits (Parus major). We used stochastic dynamic programming to predict changes in optimal breeding time under three different climate scenarios. Using these results we parametrized two theoretical models to predict critical rates. Results from both models agreed qualitatively in that even ‘mild’ rates of climate change would be close to these critical rates with respect to great tit breeding time, while for scenarios close to the upper limit of {IPCC} climate projections the calculated critical rates would be clearly exceeded with possible consequences for population persistence. We therefore tentatively conclude that micro-evolution, together with plasticity, would rescue only the population from mild rates of climate change, although the models make many simplifying assumptions that remain to be tested.},

The evolution of phenotypic plasticity creates developmental systems that are more flexible along the trait dimensions that are more plastic, and as a result, we hypothesize that such traits will express greater mutational variance, genetic variance, and evolvability. We develop an explicit gene network model with three components: some genes can receive environmental cues about the adult selective environment, some genes that interact repeatedly to determine each others’ final state, and other factors that translate these final expression states into the phenotype. We show that the evolution of phenotypic plasticity is an important determinant of mutational patterns, genetic variance, and evolutionary potential of a population. Phenotypic plasticity tends to lead to populations with greater mutational variance, greater standing genetic variance, and, when the optimal phenotypes of two traits vary in concert, greater mutational and genetic correlations. However, plastic populations do not tend to respond much more rapidly to selection than do populations evolved in a static environment. We find that the quantitative genetic descriptions of traits created by explicit developmental network models are evolutionarily labile, with genetic correlations that change rapidly with shifts in the selection regime.},

He reiterated this point a few years later in proposing that without duplicated genes the creation of metazoans, vertebrates, and mammals from unicellular organisms would have been impossible. Such big leaps in evolution, he argued, required the creation of new gene loci with previously nonexistent functions (98). Bold statements such as these, combined with his proposal that at least one whole-genome duplication event facilitated the evolution of vertebrates, have made Ohno an icon in the literature on genome evolution. However, discussion on the occurrence and consequences of gene and genome duplication events has a much longer, and often neglected, history. Here we review literature dealing with the occurence and consequences of gene duplication, begining in 1911. We document conceptual and technological advances in gene duplication research from this early research in comparative cytology up to recent research on whole genomes, “transcriptomes,” and “interactomes.” We have formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure; consequently it is quite probable that natural selection, during the long-continued course of modification, should have seized on a certain number of the primordially similar elements, many times repeated, and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes.

	abstract = {Tardigrades are able to tolerate almost complete dehydration by reversibly switching to an ametabolic state. This ability is called anhydrobiosis. In the anhydrobiotic state, tardigrades can withstand various extreme environments including space, but their molecular basis remains largely unknown. Late embryogenesis abundant ({LEA}) proteins are heat-soluble proteins and can prevent protein-aggregation in dehydrated conditions in other anhydrobiotic organisms, but their relevance to tardigrade anhydrobiosis is not clarified. In this study, we focused on the heat-soluble property characteristic of {LEA} proteins and conducted heat-soluble proteomics using an anhydrobiotic tardigrade. Our heat-soluble proteomics identified five abundant heat-soluble proteins. All of them showed no sequence similarity with {LEA} proteins and formed two novel protein families with distinct subcellular localizations. We named them Cytoplasmic Abundant Heat Soluble ({CAHS}) and Secretory Abundant Heat Soluble ({SAHS}) protein families, according to their localization. Both protein families were conserved among tardigrades, but not found in other phyla. Although {CAHS} protein was intrinsically unstructured and {SAHS} protein was rich in β-structure in the hydrated condition, proteins in both families changed their conformation to an α-helical structure in water-deficient conditions as {LEA} proteins do. Two conserved repeats of 19-mer motifs in {CAHS} proteins were capable to form amphiphilic stripes in α-helices, suggesting their roles as molecular shield in water-deficient condition, though charge distribution pattern in α-helices were different between {CAHS} and {LEA} proteins. Tardigrades might have evolved novel protein families with a heat-soluble property and this study revealed a novel repertoire of major heat-soluble proteins in these anhydrobiotic animals.},

	abstract = {Gene duplication is a major force of evolution. One whole genome duplication ({WGD}) event in the fish ancestor generated genome-wide duplicates in all modern species. Coloration and patterning on the animal body surface exhibit enormous diversity, representing a mysterious and ideal system for understanding gene evolution. Surface colors and patterns are determined primarily by pigment cells in the skin and eye. Thus, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) as a master regulator of melanocyte development is excellent for studying the evolution of {WGD}-derived gene duplicates. Here we report the evolution of mitf duplicate, mitf1 and mitf2, in the fish medaka (Oryzias latipes), which encode medaka co-homologs Mitf1 and Mitf2 of the mouse Mitf. Compared to mitf1, mitf2 exhibits an accelerated sequence divergence and loses melanocytic expression in embryos at critical developmental stages. Compared to a Xiphophorus counterpart, the medaka Mitf2 displayed a reduced activity in activating melanogenic gene expression by reporter assays and {RT}-{PCR} analyses. We show that the medaka Mitf2 has the ability to induce melanocyte differentiation in medaka embryonic stem cells but at a remarkably reduced efficiency compared to the Xiphophorus counterpart. Our data suggest differential evolution of the medaka mitf duplicate, with mitf1 adopting conservation and mitf2 employing degeneration, which is different from the duplication-degeneration-complementation proposed as the mechanism to preserve many gene duplicates in zebrafish. Our finding reveals species-specific variations for mitf duplicate evolution, in agreement with enormous diversity of body coloration and patterning.},

To date, it has been found that most polyploids are the result of multiple formation events, which may contribute to genetic diversity and affect interfertility among polyploid lineages of independent origin. A recently discovered allotetraploid derivative of Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus, Mimulus sookensis, is found throughout the valleys of western Oregon and Vancouver Island. Here, we analyse the patterns of nucleotide diversity at three chloroplast and six nuclear loci in M. guttatus, M. nasutus and M. sookensis, to gain insight into the formation of M. sookensis. By analysing the patterns of genetic variation seen in the diploid progenitors in comparison with the variation seen in M. sookensis, we are able to show that M. sookensis has recurrently formed. We also observed that most M. sookensis individuals are fixed heterozygotes at all of the nuclear loci examined, suggesting that duplicate gene loss is not extensive in M. sookensis. To assess the possibility that hybridization among M. sookensis has contributed to genetic diversity, we conducted crossing experiments within M. sookensis. We found that M. sookensis of independent origin are highly interfertile, suggesting that crossing barriers do not exist within M. sookensis, and that hybridization among M. sookensis may result in new recombinant genotypes. Together, the data suggest that although recurrent origins may be common, they can contribute to genetic diversity without contributing to reproductive isolation among independently arisen polyploid lineages.},

Nevertheless, when the mutation rate per cell division is extrapolated to the length of the sexual cycle for this protist, the measure obtained is comparable to that for multicellular species with similar genome sizes. Because Paramecium has a transcriptionally silent germ-line nucleus, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that natural selection operates on the cumulative germ-line replication fidelity per episode of somatic gene expression, with the germ-line mutation rate per cell division evolving downward to the lower barrier imposed by random genetic drift. We observe ciliate-specific modifications of widely conserved amino acid sites in {DNA} polymerases as one potential explanation for unusually high levels of replication fidelity.},

	abstract = {Alignment quality may have as much impact on phylogenetic reconstruction as the phylogenetic methods used. Not only the alignment algorithm, but also the method used to deal with the most problematic alignment regions, may have a critical effect on the final tree. Although some authors remove such problematic regions, either manually or using automatic methods, in order to improve phylogenetic performance, others prefer to keep such regions to avoid losing any information. Our aim in the present work was to examine whether phylogenetic reconstruction improves after alignment cleaning or not. Using simulated protein alignments with gaps, we tested the relative performance in diverse phylogenetic analyses of the whole alignments versus the alignments with problematic regions removed with our previously developed Gblocks program. We also tested the performance of more or less stringent conditions in the selection of blocks. Alignments constructed with different alignment methods ({ClustalW}, Mafft, and Probcons) were used to estimate phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and parsimony. We show that, in most alignment conditions, and for alignments that are not too short, removal of blocks leads to better trees. That is, despite losing some information, there is an increase in the actual phylogenetic signal. Overall, the best trees are obtained by maximum-likelihood reconstruction of alignments cleaned by Gblocks. In general, a relaxed selection of blocks is better for short alignment, whereas a stringent selection is more adequate for longer ones. Finally, we show that cleaned alignments produce better topologies although, paradoxically, with lower bootstrap. This indicates that divergent and problematic alignment regions may lead, when present, to apparently better supported although, in fact, more biased topologies.},

	abstract = {Despite more than 3 billion years since the origin of life on earth, the powerful forces of biological evolution seem to have failed to generate any living cell that is devoid of a dense and complex array of cell surface glycans. Thus, cell surface glycans seem to be as essential for life as having a {DNA} genetic code, diverse {RNAs}, structural/functional proteins, lipid-based membranes, and metabolites that mediate energy flux and signaling. The likely reasons for this apparently universal law of biology are considered here, and include the fact that glycans have the greatest potential for generating diversity, and thus evading recognition by pathogens. This may also explain why in striking contrast to the genetic code, glycans show widely divergent patterns between taxa. On the other hand, glycans have also been coopted for myriad intrinsic functions, which can vary in their importance for organismal survival. In keeping with these considerations, a significant percentage of the genes in the typical genome are dedicated to the generation and/or turnover of glycans. Among eukaryotes, the Golgi is the subcellular organelle that serves to generate much of the diversity of cell surface glycans, carrying out various glycan modifications of glycoconjugates that transit through the Golgi, en route to the cell surface or extracellular destinations. Here I present an overview of general considerations regarding the selective forces shaping evolution of the Golgi glycosylation machinery, and then briefly discuss the common types of variations seen in each major class of glycans, finally focusing on sialic acids as an extreme example of evolutionary glycan diversity generated by the Golgi. Future studies need to address both the phylogenetic diversity the Golgi and the molecular mechanisms for its rapid responses to intrinsic and environmental stimuli., Glycans are present on the surface of all living cells. Their great diversity helps cells mediate intrinsic functions, as well as avoid pathogens, and is generated primarily in the Golgi, where multiple enzymes compete for multiple substrates over a short time period.},

	abstract = {De novo motif discovery has been an important challenge of bioinformatics for the past two decades. Since the emergence of high-throughput techniques like {ChIP}-seq, {ChIP}-exo and protein-binding microarrays ({PBMs}), the focus of de novo motif discovery has shifted to runtime and accuracy on large data sets. For this purpose, specialized algorithms have been designed for discovering motifs in {ChIP}-seq or {PBM} data. However, none of the existing approaches work perfectly for all three high-throughput techniques. In this article, we propose Dimont, a general approach for fast and accurate de novo motif discovery from high-throughput data. We demonstrate that Dimont yields a higher number of correct motifs from {ChIP}-seq data than any of the specialized approaches and achieves a higher accuracy for predicting {PBM} intensities from probe sequence than any of the approaches specifically designed for that purpose. Dimont also reports the expected motifs for several {ChIP}-exo data sets. Investigating differences between in vitro and in vivo binding, we find that for most transcription factors, the motifs discovered by Dimont are in good accordance between techniques, but we also find notable exceptions. We also observe that modeling intra-motif dependencies may increase accuracy, which indicates that more complex motif models are a worthwhile field of research.},

	abstract = {* 1Many theoretical models have been proposed to explain the empirical self-thinning relationship given by Yoda et al. in 1963 for even-aged, monospecific stands of plants, but the models are inadequate to allow consensus on the processes driving variation in density-dependent mortality and self-thinning.
* 2Most non-individual based models (non-{IBMs}), and many {IBMs}, employ a common representation of competition in which a finite amount of potential crown area remains completely allocated throughout self-thinning, making stand density inversely proportional to mean projected crown area.
* 3This representation entails four assumptions regarding the competition process: the population is adequately represented by the mean plant; total stand resource utilization is constant throughout self-thinning; competition is a horizontal packing process; and differences in initial stand conditions may affect the rate of competition but not the process itself.
* 4Reviewing published empirical data, the competition literature and the logical implications for the self-thinning process shows that all four assumptions are untenable as generalizations. Unfortunately, their application provides neither a mortality-inducing mechanism nor insight into the relationship between stand growth and mortality.
* 5Explaining the observed variation in self-thinning relationships therefore requires improved representation of the competition process. This improvement is likely to require {IBMs} that explicitly represent variation in plant size or resource acquisition, two-dimensional stand distribution, dynamic rather than static stand resource utilization, and, perhaps, explicit three-dimensional stand development. Most importantly, the requirement for explicitly modelling mortality mechanisms implies that whole plant models may be insufficient for insight into the self-thinning process.
* 6The review reinforces the need to assess mechanistic models for more than their ability to reproduce a single, high-level pattern. Such models should be assessed for their ability to simultaneously reproduce multiple features selected from the levels of both the modelled mechanisms and the high-level patterns.

In eukaryotes, four subfamilies can be distinguished according to their function and localisation in different cellular compartments: cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Generally, multiple cytosol-type Hsp70s can be found in metazoans that show either constitutive expression and/or stress-inducibility, arguing for the evolution of different tasks and functions. Information about the hsp70 copy number and diversity in microbial eukaryotes is, however, scarce, and detailed knowledge about the differential gene expression in most protists is lacking. Therefore, we have characterised the Hsp70 gene family of Paramecium caudatum to gain insight into the evolution and differential heat stress response of the distinct family members in protists and to investigate the diversification of eukaryotic hsp70s focusing on the evolution of heat-inducibility.

	abstract = {Background Biological invasions are a major ecological and socio-economic problem in many parts of the world. Despite an explosion of research in recent decades, much remains to be understood about why some species become invasive whereas others do not. Recently, polyploidy (whole genome duplication) has been proposed as an important determinant of invasiveness in plants. Genome duplication has played a major role in plant evolution and can drastically alter a plant's genetic make-up, morphology, physiology and ecology within only one or a few generations. This may allow some polyploids to succeed in strongly fluctuating environments and/or effectively colonize new habitats and, thus, increase their potential to be invasive.
Scope We synthesize current knowledge on the importance of polyploidy for the invasion (i.e. spread) of introduced plants. We first aim to elucidate general mechanisms that are involved in the success of polyploid plants and translate this to that of plant invaders. Secondly, we provide an overview of ploidal levels in selected invasive alien plants and explain how ploidy might have contributed to their success.
Conclusions Polyploidy can be an important factor in species invasion success through a combination of (1) ‘pre-adaptation’, whereby polyploid lineages are predisposed to conditions in the new range and, therefore, have higher survival rates and fitness in the earliest establishment phase; and (2) the possibility for subsequent adaptation due to a larger genetic diversity that may assist the ‘evolution of invasiveness’. Alternatively, polyploidization may play an important role by (3) restoring sexual reproduction following hybridization or, conversely, (4) asexual reproduction in the absence of suitable mates. We, therefore, encourage invasion biologists to incorporate assessments of ploidy in their studies of invasive alien species.},

	abstract = {Gene duplication is an important process in the functional divergence of genes and genomes. Several processes have been described that lead to duplicate gene retention over different timescales after both smaller-scale events and whole-genome duplication, including neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, and dosage balance. Two common modes of duplicate gene loss include nonfunctionalization and loss due to population dynamics (failed fixation). Previous work has characterized expectations of duplicate gene retention under the neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization models. Here, that work is extended to dosage balance using simulations. A general model for duplicate gene loss/retention is then presented that is capable of fitting expectations under the different models, is defined at t = 0, and decays to an orthologous asymptotic rate rather than zero, based upon a modified Weibull hazard function. The model in a maximum likelihood framework shows the property of identifiability, recovering the evolutionary mechanism and parameters of simulation. This model is also capable of recovering the evolutionary mechanism of simulation from data generated using an unrelated network population genetic model. Lastly, the general model is applied as part of a mixture model to recent gene duplicates from the Oikopleura dioica genome, suggesting that neofunctionalization may be an important process leading to duplicate gene retention in that organism.},

	abstract = {Background
Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic acid ({DNA}) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short {DNA} segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in {DNA} motif finding algorithms.

Results
Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but perform significantly worse in higher organisms.

Conclusion
Despite considerable efforts to date, {DNA} motif finding remains a complex challenge for biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over motif models.},

metabolic network is both a network of chemical reactions and
a network of enzymes that catalyze reactions. Toward better understanding
of this duality in the evolution of the metabolic network, we developed
a method to extract conserved sequences of reactions called reaction
modules from the analysis of chemical compound structure transformation
patterns in all known metabolic pathways stored in the {KEGG} {PATHWAY}
database. The extracted reaction modules are repeatedly used as if
they are building blocks of the metabolic network and contain chemical
logic of organic reactions. Furthermore, the reaction modules often
correspond to traditional pathway modules defined as sets of enzymes
in the {KEGG} {MODULE} database and sometimes to operon-like gene clusters
in prokaryotic genomes. We identified well-conserved, possibly ancient,
reaction modules involving 2-oxocarboxylic acids. The chain extension
module that appears as the tricarboxylic acid ({TCA}) reaction sequence
in the {TCA} cycle is now shown to be used in other pathways together
with different types of modification modules. We also identified reaction
modules and their connection patterns for aromatic ring cleavages
in microbial biodegradation pathways, which are most characteristic
in terms of both distinct reaction sequences and distinct gene clusters.
The modular architecture of biodegradation modules will have a potential
for predicting degradation pathways of xenobiotic compounds. The collection
of these and many other reaction modules is made available as part
of the {KEGG} database.},

	abstract = {Pain is mediated by functionally distinctive components. It may involve acute high threshold afferent stimuli (thermal, mechanical or chemically damaged tissue), protracted afferent input (long-lasting hyperalgesia) or low-threshold input (allodynia as related to pain from light touch). Behavioral patterns will be associated with the effects of noxious stimulus on excitatory transmitters. Humane studies using mechanical, thermal (cold pressor test), audio-evoked potentials, or other noxious stimuli during anesthesia and analgesia provide clues to perception of pain in animals and help us determine guidelines for the clinical relief of animal pain. There is a better understanding of cutaneous somatosensory responses than for deep sensation (e.g., subcutaneous tissue, muscle, bone, viscera). The prevention or treatment of pain can best be accomplished when there is a diagnosis of the neuroanatomical distribution of the pain based on evidence of sensory dysfunction involving a peripheral nerve, plexus, nerve root or central pathway using different modalities for quantitative sensory testing. Anatomical studies have demonstrated that unmyelinated primary afferent fibers contain a variety of neuroactive substances which may be released by high-intensity peripheral stimulation. Fast depolarization of the dorsal horn nociresponsive neurons is mediated by tissue damage. These neuroreceptors may be activated by glutamate, substance P, and neurokinin A. The major ascending pathway relaying nociceptive information relating to pain is the spinothalamic tract. Most of the neurons in this tract are nociceptive or thermoreceptive. The thalamus is the final relay nucleus for all the sensory systems, except olfactory tissue. Injury or disease processes in deeper tissue or visceral areas with extensive innervation may result in pain thresholds not adequately controlled by current available analgesics or at their recommended dosage levels. These issues are complex and diagnosis is even more difficult due to species and breed differences in outward expression to painful insult. Medications can now be targeted for specific receptors.},

These coordinated expression-patterns are maintained primarily through the process of transcriptional regulation. Transcriptional regulation is mediated by proteins binding to regulatory elements on the {DNA} in a combinatorial manner, where particular combinations of transcription factor binding sites establish specific regulatory codes. In this review, we survey experimental and computational approaches geared towards the identification of proximal and distal gene regulatory elements in the genomes of complex eukaryotes. Available approaches that decipher the genetic structure and function of regulatory elements by exploiting various sources of information like gene expression data, chromatin structure, {DNA}-binding specificities of transcription factors, cooperativity of transcription factors, etc. are highlighted. We also discuss the relevance of regulatory elements in the context of human health through examples of mutations in some of these regions having serious implications in misregulation of genes and being strongly associated with human disorders.},

This framework provides new insights into the nature of climate niche shifts and our ability to anticipate invasions, and may help in guiding the design of experiments for assessing causes of niche changes.},

	abstract = {It is one of the most important tasks in bioinformatics to identify the regulatory elements in gene sequences. Most of the existing algorithms for identifying regulatory elements are inclined to converge into a local optimum, and have high time complexity. Ant Colony Optimization ({ACO}) is a meta-heuristic method based on swarm intelligence and is derived from a model inspired by the collective foraging behavior of real ants. Taking advantage of the {ACO} in traits such as self-organization and robustness, this paper designs and implements an {ACO} based algorithm named {ACRI} (ant-colony-regulatory-identification) for identifying all possible binding sites of transcription factor from the upstream of co-expressed genes. To accelerate the ants' searching process, a strategy of local optimization is presented to adjust the ants' start positions on the searched sequences. By exploiting the powerful optimization ability of {ACO}, the algorithm {ACRI} can not only improve precision of the results, but also achieve a very high speed. Experimental results on real world datasets show that {ACRI} can outperform other traditional algorithms in the respects of speed and quality of solutions.},

Although the rapid development of technologies allows central questions to be addressed at an unprecedented level of molecular detail, they do not alleviate one of the major challenges of {EEG}, which is that a large fraction of genes remains without any annotation. Here, we propose two solutions to this challenge. The first solution is in the form of a database that regroups associations between genes, organismal attributes and abiotic and biotic conditions. This database would result in an ecological annotation of genes by allowing cross-referencing across studies and taxa. Our second solution is to use new functional techniques to characterize genes implicated in the response to ecological challenges.},

Communicating with a lay audience about scientific subjects and making them attractive is a difficult task. But difficult or not, you will have to do it for many years, not only with your family and friends, but also with your colleagues and collaborators. So, better learn now! Although not usually taught, the ability to explain your work to others is an essential skill in science, where communication plays a key role. Using some examples of the French Regional Student Group activities, we discuss here (i) why it is important to have such communication skills, (ii) how you can get involved in these activities by using existing resources or working with people who have previous experience, and (iii) what you get out of this amazing experience. We aim to motivate you and provide you with tips and ideas to get involved in promoting scientific activities while getting all the benefits.},

To achieve these goals, it is essential to foster the development of what we call efficient theories, which have several key attributes. Efficient theories are grounded in first principles, are usually expressed in the language of mathematics, make few assumptions and generate a large number of predictions per free parameter, are approximate, and entail predictions that provide well-understood standards for comparison with empirical data. We contend that the development and successive refinement of efficient theories provide a solid foundation for advancing environmental science in the era of big data.},

	abstract = {Polyploidy, or whole genome duplication, has played a major role in the evolution of many eukaryotic lineages. Although the prevalence of polyploidy in plants is well documented, the molecular and cytological consequences are understood largely from newly formed polyploids (neopolyploids) that have been grown experimentally. Classical cytological and molecular cytogenetic studies both have shown that experimental neoallopolyploids often have meiotic irregularities, producing chromosomally variable gametes and progeny; however, little is known about the extent or duration of chromosomal variation in natural neoallopolyploid populations. We report the results of a molecular cytogenetic study on natural populations of a neoallopolyploid, Tragopogon miscellus, which formed multiple times in the past 80 y. Using genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we uncovered massive and repeated patterns of chromosomal variation in all populations. No population was fixed for a particular karyotype; 76\% of the individuals showed intergenomic translocations, and 69\% were aneuploid for one or more chromosomes. Importantly, 85\% of plants exhibiting aneuploidy still had the expected chromosome number, mostly through reciprocal monosomy-trisomy of homeologous chromosomes (1:3 copies) or nullisomy-tetrasomy (0:4 copies). The extensive chromosomal variation still present after ca. 40 generations in this biennial species suggests that substantial and prolonged chromosomal instability might be common in natural populations after whole genome duplication. A protracted period of genome instability in neoallopolyploids may increase opportunities for alterations to genome structure, losses of coding and noncoding {DNA}, and changes in gene expression.},

	abstract = {Duplications of genes encoding highly connected and essential proteins are selected against in several species but not in human, where duplicated genes encode highly connected proteins. To understand when and how gene duplicability changed in evolution, we compare gene and network properties in four species (Escherichia coli, yeast, fly, and human) that are representative of the increase in evolutionary complexity, defined as progressive growth in the number of genes, cells, and cell types. We find that the origin and conservation of a gene significantly correlates with the properties of the encoded protein in the protein-protein interaction network. All four species preserve a core of singleton and central hubs that originated early in evolution, are highly conserved, and accomplish basic biological functions. Another group of hubs appeared in metazoans and duplicated in vertebrates, mostly through vertebrate-specific whole genome duplication. Such recent and duplicated hubs are frequently targets of {microRNAs} and show tissue-selective expression, suggesting that these are alternative mechanisms to control their dosage. Our study shows how networks modified during evolution and contributes to explaining the occurrence of somatic genetic diseases, such as cancer, in terms of network perturbations.},

Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.},

	abstract = {Gene regulation change has long been recognized as an important mechanism for phenotypic evolution. We used the evolution of yeast aerobic fermentation as a model to explore how gene regulation has evolved and how this process has contributed to phenotypic evolution and adaptation. Most eukaryotes fully oxidize glucose to {CO}2 and H2O in mitochondria to maximize energy yield, whereas some yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its relatives, predominantly ferment glucose into ethanol even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as aerobic fermentation. We examined the genome-wide gene expression levels among 12 different yeasts and found that a group of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiration process showed the largest reduction in gene expression level during the evolution of aerobic fermentation. Our analysis revealed that the downregulation of these genes was significantly associated with massive loss of binding motifs of Cbf1p in the fermentative yeasts. Our experimental assays confirmed the binding of Cbf1p to the predicted motif and the activator role of Cbf1p. In summary, our study laid a foundation to unravel the long-time mystery about the genetic basis of evolution of aerobic fermentation, providing new insights into understanding the role of cis-regulatory changes in phenotypic evolution.},

However, plant strategies may also represent density- or frequency-dependent adaptations to the strategies used by neighbours. Game theory provides the tools to characterise such density- and frequency-dependent interactions. Here, we review the contributions of game theory to plant ecology. After briefly reviewing game theory from the perspective of plant ecology, we divide our review into three sections. First, game theoretical models of allocation to shoots and roots often predict investment in those organs beyond what would be optimal in the absence of competition. Second, game theoretical models of enemy defence suggest that an individual's investment in defence is not only a means of reducing its own tissue damage but also a means of deflecting enemies onto competitors. Finally, game theoretical models of trade with mutualistic partners suggest that the optimal trade may reflect competition for access to mutualistic partners among plants. In short, our review provides an accessible entrance to game theory that will help plant ecologists enrich their research with its worldview and existing predictions.},

First, tree diagrams which show the close analogy with the screening test problem. Similar conclusions are drawn by repeated simulations of t-tests. These mimic what is done in real life, which makes the results more persuasive. The simulation method is used also to evaluate the extent to which effect sizes are over-estimated, especially in underpowered experiments.

	abstract = {To understand empirical patterns of phenotypic plasticity, we need to explore the complexities of environmental heterogeneity and how it interacts with cue reliability. I consider both temporal and spatial variation separately and in combination, the timing of temporal variation relative to development, the timing of movement relative to selection, and two different patterns of movement: stepping-stone and island. Among-generation temporal heterogeneity favors plasticity, while within-generation heterogeneity can result in cue unreliability. In general, spatial variation more strongly favors plasticity than temporal variation, and island migration more strongly favors plasticity than stepping-stone migration. Negative correlations among environments between the time of development and selection can result in seemingly maladaptive reaction norms. The effects of higher dispersal rates depend on the life history stage when dispersal occurs and the pattern of environmental heterogeneity. Thus, patterns of environmental heterogeneity can be complex and can interact in unforeseen ways to affect cue reliability. Proper interpretation of patterns of trait plasticity requires consideration of the ecology and biology of the organism. More information on actual cue reliability and the ecological and developmental context of trait plasticity is needed.},

	abstract = {The discovery of ancient whole-genome duplications in eukaryotic lineages has renewed the interest in polyploidy and its effects on the diversification of organisms. Polyploidy has large-scale effects on both genotype and phenotype and has been linked to the evolution of genome size, dioecy, and changes in ecological interactions, such as pollinator visitation. Here, we take a molecular systematics approach to examine the evolution of polyploidy in the plant genus Thalictrum (Ranunculaceae) and test its correlation to changes in genome size, sexual system, and pollination mode. Thalictrum is an ideal study system due to its extensive ploidy range and floral diversity. Phylogenetic analyses were used for character reconstructions, correlation tests, and dating estimates. Our results suggest that polyploidization occurred frequently and recently in the evolution of Thalictrum, mostly within the last 10.6–5.8 My, coinciding with the diversification of particular clades. In spite of an overall trend of genomic downsizing accompanying polyploidy in angiosperms and proportional increases observed at finer scales, our genome size estimates for Thalictrum show no correlation with chromosome number. Instead, we observe genomic expansion in diploids and genomic contraction in polyploids with increased age. Additionally, polyploidy is not correlated with dioecy in Thalictrum; therefore, other factors must have influenced the evolution of separate sexes in this group. A novel finding from our study is the association of polyploidy with shifts to wind pollination, in particular, during a time period of global cooling and mountain uplift in the Americas.},

Temporal changes in the mean phenotype caused by transient fluctuations in the age-distribution and variation in mean phenotype among age classes, which can mistakenly be interpreted as selection, will disappear if reproductive value weighting is applied. Changes in any weighted mean phenotype in an age-structured population may be decomposed into between- and within-age class components. Using reproductive value weighting the between-age class component becomes pure noise, generated by previous genetic drift or fluctuating selection. This component, which we call transient quasi-selection, can therefore be omitted when estimating age-specific selection on fecundity or viability within age classes. The final response can be computed at the time of selection, but can not be observed until lifetime reproduction is realized unless the heritability is one. The generality of these results is illustrated further by our derivation of the selection differential for the continuous time age-structured model with general age-dependent weights. A simple simulation example as well as estimation of selection components in a house sparrow population illustrates the applicability of the theory to analyze selection on the mean phenotype in fluctuating age-structured populations.},

Recent studies seeking biological explanations for this pattern have emphasized the role of niche differentiation, as in hypotheses of adaptive radiation and ecological limits to diversity.

In this paper, we focus on the geographic context of diversification, environment-driven bursts of speciation, failure of clades to keep pace with a changing environment, and protracted speciation. We argue that, despite being currently underemphasized, these alternatives represent biologically plausible explanations that should be considered along with niche differentiation. Testing the importance of these alternative hypotheses might yield fundamentally different explanations for what influences species richness within clades through time.},

	abstract = {* Determining the causes of cyclic fluctuations in population size is a central tenet in population ecology and provides insights into population regulatory mechanisms. We have a firm understanding of how direct and delayed density dependence affects population stability and cyclic dynamics, but there remains considerable uncertainty in the specific processes contributing to demographic variability and consequent change in cyclic propensity.


* Spatiotemporal variability in cyclic propensity, including recent attenuation or loss of cyclicity among several temperate populations and the implications of habitat fragmentation and climate change on this pattern, highlights the heightened need to understand processes underlying cyclic variation. Because these stressors can differentially impact survival and productivity and thereby impose variable time delays in density dependence, there is a specific need to elucidate how demographic vital rates interact with the type and action of density dependence to contribute to population stability and cyclic variation.


* Here, we address this knowledge gap by comparing the stability of time series derived from general and species-specific (Canada lynx: Lynx canadensis; small rodents: Microtus, Lemmus and Clethrionomys spp.) matrix population models, which vary in their demographic rates and the direct action of density dependence.


* Our results reveal that density dependence acting exclusively on survival as opposed to productivity is destabilizing, suggesting that a shift in the action of population regulation toward reproductive output may decrease cyclic propensity and cycle amplitude. This result was the same whether delayed density dependence was pulsatile and acted on a single time period (e.g. t−1, t−2 or t−3) vs. more constant by affecting a successive range of years (e.g. t−1,…, t−3).


* Consistent with our general models, reductions in reproductive potential in both the lynx and small rodent systems led to notably large drops in cyclic propensity and amplitude, suggesting that changes in this vital rate may contribute to the spatial or temporal variability observed in the cyclic dynamics of both systems.


* Collectively, our results reveal that the type of density dependence and its effect on different demographic parameters can profoundly influence numeric stability and cyclic propensity and therefore may shift populations across the cyclic-to-noncyclic boundary.},

	abstract = {Standard microbial evolutionary ontology is organized according to a nested hierarchy of entities at various levels of biological organization. It typically detects and defines these entities in relation to the most stable aspects of evolutionary processes, by identifying lineages evolving by a process of vertical inheritance from an ancestral entity. However, recent advances in microbiology indicate that such an ontology has important limitations. The various dynamics detected within microbiological systems reveal that a focus on the most stable entities (or features of entities) over time inevitably underestimates the extent and nature of microbial diversity. These dynamics are not the outcome of the process of vertical descent alone. Other processes, often involving causal interactions between entities from distinct levels of biological organisation, or operating at different time scales, are responsible not only for the destabilisation of pre-existing entities, but also for the emergence and stabilisation of novel entities in the microbial world. In this article we consider microbial entities as more or less stabilised functional wholes, and sketch a network-based ontology that can represent a diverse set of processes including, for example, as well as phylogenetic relations, interactions that stabilise or destabilise the interacting entities, spatial relations, ecological connections, and genetic exchanges. We use this pluralistic framework for evaluating (i) the existing ontological assumptions in evolution (e.g. whether currently recognized entities are adequate for understanding the causes of change and stabilisation in the microbial world), and (ii) for identifying hidden ontological kinds, essentially invisible from within a more limited perspective. We propose to recognize additional classes of entities that provide new insights into the structure of the microbial world, namely “processually equivalent” entities, “processually versatile” entities, and “stabilized” entities.},

	abstract = {Background
Microalgae have the potential to deliver biofuels without the associated competition for land resources. In order to realise the rates and titres necessary for commercial production, however, system-level metabolic engineering will be required. Genome scale metabolic reconstructions have revolutionized microbial metabolic engineering and are used routinely for in silico analysis and design. While genome scale metabolic reconstructions have been developed for many prokaryotes and model eukaryotes, the application to less well characterized eukaryotes such as algae is challenging not at least due to a lack of compartmentalization data.

Results
We have developed a genome-scale metabolic network model (named {AlgaGEM}) covering the metabolism for a compartmentalized algae cell based on the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome. {AlgaGEM} is a comprehensive literature-based genome scale metabolic reconstruction that accounts for the functions of 866 unique {ORFs}, 1862 metabolites, 2249 gene-enzyme-reaction-association entries, and 1725 unique reactions. The reconstruction was compartmentalized into the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plastid and microbody using available data for algae complemented with compartmentalisation data for Arabidopsis thaliana. {AlgaGEM} describes a functional primary metabolism of Chlamydomonas and significantly predicts distinct algal behaviours such as the catabolism or secretion rather than recycling of phosphoglycolate in photorespiration. {AlgaGEM} was validated through the simulation of growth and algae metabolic functions inferred from literature. Using efficient resource utilisation as the optimality criterion, {AlgaGEM} predicted observed metabolic effects under autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. {AlgaGEM} predicts increased hydrogen production when cyclic electron flow is disrupted as seen in a high producing mutant derived from mutational studies. The model also predicted the physiological pathway for H2 production and identified new targets to further improve H2 yield.

Conclusions
{AlgaGEM} is a viable and comprehensive framework for in silico functional analysis and can be used to derive new, non-trivial hypotheses for exploring this metabolically versatile organism. Flux balance analysis can be used to identify bottlenecks and new targets to metabolically engineer microalgae for production of biofuels.},

Nowadays many problems may be tackled with “higher” eukaryotic/metazoan cells for which full genomic information as well as domain databases, etc., were available long before protozoa. Established molecular tools, commercial antibodies, and established pharmacology are additional advantages available for higher eukaryotic cells. Moreover, an increasing number of inherited genetic disturbances in humans have become elucidated and can serve as new models. Among lower eukaryotes, yeast will remain a standard model because of its peculiarities, including its reduced genome and availability in the haploid form. But do protists still have a future as models? This touches not only the basic understanding of biology but also practical aspects of research, such as fund raising. As we try to scrutinize, due to specific advantages some protozoa should and will remain favorable models for analyzing novel genes or specific aspects of cell structure and function.

It was an idea of Professor Livia Tonolli, who wanted to honour Professor Giuseppe Ramazzotti, at that time the authority in that scientific field and her friend. Considering that tardigrades are a neglected group of metazoans (still to date), this particular event could be finished with that occasion, but it has not been so. With some gaps, the meetings have been proceeded till now, promoting scientific exchange among the researchers and improving the research quality. Following these 35 years and the topics of the symposia, we can understand the changing in the scientific approach. Taxonomy and faunal studies were the predominant topics of the first symposium, but also ultrastructural morphology, ecology, physiology, cytotaxonomy and reproductive biology were represented. Furthermore, the studies by {SEM} moved their first steps in that occasion. Faunal and taxonomic studies represented often the main topic during the years, but also other kinds of researches involving phylogeny, physiology, ultrastructure of organs and cells always accompanied it. From these points of view, often tardigrades were compared with other animal groups, giving a wider sense to the research. Molecular aspects were already considered in the third symposium (1980, Tennessee), but reconsidered only in the symposium in Cambridge (1994) and developed from the symposium in Denmark (2000). The last symposia showed an increased number of participants and scientific contributions. In line with the increasingly international nature of publications, the quality of the proceedings has also increased, always using in the last 10 years qualified international journals with peer review and impact factor, as now required by young scientists to further their careers.},

Because the {DNA} motif recognized by a transcription factor is typically short and degenerate, computational approaches for identifying binding sites based only on the sequence motif inevitably suffer from high error rates. Current state-of-the-art techniques for improving computational identification of binding sites can be broadly categorized into two classes: (1) approaches that aim to improve binding motif models by extracting maximal sequence information from experimentally determined binding sites and (2) approaches that supplement binding motif models with additional genomic or other attributes (such as evolutionary conservation). In this review we will discuss recent attempts to improve computational identification of {TFBS} through these two types of approaches and conclude with thoughts on future development.

	abstract = {In this paper, a case is made for the use of model-based approaches for the analysis of community data. This involves the direct specification of a statistical model for the observed multivariate data. Recent advances in statistical modelling mean that it is now possible to build models that are appropriate for the data which address key ecological questions in a statistically coherent manner. Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and efficiency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model-based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first example, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.},

Members of the Ago subclade, which are present in most eukaryotic phyla, bind different classes of small {RNAs} and regulate gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Piwi subclade members appear to have been lost in plants and fungi and were mostly studied in metazoa, where they bind {piRNAs} and have essential roles in sexual reproduction. Their presence in ciliates, unicellular organisms harbouring both germline micronuclei and somatic macronuclei, offers an interesting perspective on the evolution of their functions. Here, we report phylogenetic and functional analyses of the 15 Piwi genes from Paramecium tetraurelia. We show that four constitutively expressed proteins are involved in {siRNA} pathways that mediate gene silencing throughout the life cycle. Two other proteins, specifically expressed during meiosis, are required for accumulation of {scnRNAs} during sexual reproduction and for programmed genome rearrangements during development of the somatic macronucleus. Our results indicate that Paramecium Piwi proteins have evolved to perform both vegetative and sexual functions through mechanisms ranging from post-transcriptional {mRNA} cleavage to epigenetic regulation of genome rearrangements.},

Recently, eel research has gained in urgency, as the population has dwindled to the point of critical endangerment. We have assembled a draft genome in order to facilitate advances in all provinces of eel biology. Here, we use the genome to investigate the eel's complement of the Hox developmental transcription factors. We show that unlike any other teleost fish, the eel retains fully populated, duplicate Hox clusters, which originated at the teleost-specific genome duplication. Using {mRNA}-sequencing and in situ hybridizations, we demonstrate that all copies are expressed in early embryos. Theories of vertebrate evolution predict that the retention of functional, duplicate Hox genes can give rise to additional developmental complexity, which is not immediately apparent in the adult. However, the key morphological innovation elsewhere in the eel's life history coincides with the evolutionary origin of its Hox repertoire.},

	abstract = {While all ciliates possess nuclear dimorphism, several ciliates – like those in the classes Phyllopharyngea, Spirotrichea, and Armophorea – have an extreme macronuclear organization. Their extensively fragmented macronuclei contain upwards of 20,000 chromosomes, each with upwards of thousands of copies. These features have evolved independently on multiple occasions throughout ciliate evolutionary history, and currently no models explain these structures in an evolutionary context. In this paper, we propose that competition between two forces – the limitation and avoidance of chromosomal imbalances as a ciliate undergoes successive asexual divisions, and the costs of replicating massive genomes – is sufficient to explain this particular nuclear structure. We present a simulation of ciliate cell evolution under control of these forces, allowing certain features of the population to change over time. Over a wide range of parameters, we observe the repeated emergence of this unusual genomic organization found in nature. Although much remains to be understood about the evolution of macronuclear genome organization, our results show that the proposed model is a plausible explanation for the emergence of these extremely fragmented, highly polyploid genomes.},

The experimental units of the {TARSE} project were housed in the {BIOKON} facility installed inside the Russian spacecraft {FOTON}-M3. In this paper, data on survival rate, Hsps expression (70 and 90 {kDa}) and genomic {DNA} integrity (double-strand breaks) of flown desiccated animals, and from specimens of ground control experiments are presented. For the flown experiments, microcosms of dry leaf litter collected in the field containing naturally desiccated specimens and blot filter papers containing specimens desiccated in laboratory under controlled conditions were used. After the space flight, desiccated animals had high survival rates (from 79\% to 95\%) showing a similar survival rate to that observed in ground controls. No visible damages to double-strand genomic {DNA} were observed in all desiccated samples, whereas Hsp70 and Hsp90 levels of flown tardigrades were higher than those of ground controls. These data combined with earlier published results on hydrated specimens of P. richtersi indicate that tardigrades have the ability to tolerate for a short time period stresses typical of the extraterrestrial environment such as microgravity and radiations.},

Their interaction with specific elements in the {DNA} mediates dynamic changes in transcriptional activity. Databases store a growing number of known {DNA} sequence patterns, also denoted as {DNA} sequence motifs that are recognized by transcription factors. Such databases can be searched to find a match for a newly discovered pattern and that way identify the potential binding factor. It is also of interest to cluster motifs in order to examine which transcription factors have similar binding properties and, thus, may promiscuously bind to each other's sites, or how many distinct specificities have been described. To gain deeper insight into the similarities between {DNA} sequence motifs, we analyzed a comprehensive set of known motifs. For this purpose we devised a network-based approach that enabled us to identify clusters of related motifs that largely coincided with grouping of related {TFs} on the basis of protein similarity. On the basis of these results, we were able to predict whether two motifs belong to the same subgroup and constructed a novel, fully-automated method for motif clustering, which enables users to assess the similarity of a newly found motif with all known motifs in the collection.},

In this study, we explored the impact of an invasive plant Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) at 24 grassland sites invaded for different periods of time (from 11 to 48 years). Native species' richness and productivity were initially reduced by hogweed invasion but tended to recover after 30 years of hogweed residence at the sites. Hogweed cover declined over the whole period assessed. A complementary common garden experiment suggested that the dynamics observed in the field were due to a negative plant–soil feedback; hogweed survival and biomass, and its competitive ability were lower when growing in soil inocula collected from earlier-invaded grasslands. Our results provide evidence that the initial dominance of an invasive plant species and its negative impact can later be reversed by stabilising processes.},

	abstract = {Polyploidy, or whole genome duplication, is recognized as an important feature of eukaryotic genome evolution. Among eukaryotes, polyploidy has probably had the largest evolutionary impact on vascular plants where many contemporary species are of recent polyploid origin. Genomic analyses have uncovered evidence of at least one round of polyploidy in the ancestry of most plants, fueling speculation that genome duplications lead to increases in net diversity. In spite of the frequency of ancient polyploidy, recent analyses have found that recently formed polyploid species have higher extinction rates than their diploid relatives. These results suggest that despite leaving a substantial legacy in plant genomes, only rare polyploids survive over the long term and most are evolutionary dead-ends.},

	abstract = {It is now widely recognized that gene expression and cellular processes include a probabilistic component. However, this does not essentially modify the theory of genetic programming. This stochastic aspect, which is called noise, is usually conceived as a margin of fluctuation in the way the genetic program functions and the latter remains understood as a specific mechanism guided by genetic information. In contrast, recent data show that proteins do not possess a high level of specificity. They can interact with numerous molecular partners. As a consequence molecular interactions are not simply "noisy". Because they are subject to large combinatorial interaction possibilities, they are also intrinsically stochastic and must be sorted out by the cell structure. This contradicts the genetic programming theory which is based on the idea that protein interactions are directed by their stereospecificity and genetic information. Taking into account the lack of protein specificity leads to a new theory. Natural selection acts not only in evolution but also in ontogenesis by sorting stochastic molecular interactions. In this frame, the making up of an organism, instead of being a simple bottom-top process in which information flows from genes to phenotypes, is both a bottom-top and top-bottom process. Genes provide proteins, but their stochastic interactions are sorted by selective constraints arising from the cell and multi-cellular structures, which are themselves subject to the action of natural selection.},

We further demonstrate that the retention of many ohnologs suspected to be dosage balanced is in fact indirectly mediated by their susceptibility to deleterious mutations. This enhanced retention of "dangerous" ohnologs, defined as prone to autosomal-dominant deleterious mutations, is shown to be a consequence of {WGD}-induced speciation and the ensuing purifying selection in post-{WGD} species. These findings highlight the importance of {WGD}-induced nonadaptive selection for the emergence of vertebrate complexity, while rationalizing, from an evolutionary perspective, the expansion of gene families frequently implicated in genetic disorders and cancers.},

This basal eudicot species is especially important from an evolutionary perspective, as it occupies a critical phylogenetic position in flowering plants. Here we report the draft genome of a wild strain of sacred lotus. The assembled genome is 792 Mb, which is approximately 85–90\% of genome size estimates. We annotated 392 Mb of repeat sequences and 36 385 protein-coding genes within the genome. Using these sequence data, we constructed a phylogenetic tree and confirmed the basal location of sacred lotus within eudicots. Importantly, we found evidence for a relatively recent whole-genome duplication event; any indication of the ancient paleo-hexaploid event was, however, absent. Genomic analysis revealed evidence of positive selection within 28 embryo-defective genes and one annexin gene that may be related to the long-term viability of sacred lotus seed. We also identified a significant expansion of starch synthase genes, which probably elevated starch levels within the rhizome of sacred lotus. Sequencing this strain of sacred lotus thus provided important insights into the evolution of flowering plant and revealed genetic mechanisms that influence seed dormancy and starch synthesis.},

Human health is sensitive to apparently trivial psychological stimuli, negatively affected by the risk of environmental degradation, and positively affected by contact with natural spaces. This suggests that well-being and health should be affected by biodiversity change, but few studies have begun to explore these relationships. Here, we develop a framework for linking biodiversity change with human cultural values, well-being, and health. We argue that better understanding these relations might be profoundly important for biodiversity conservation and public health.},

	abstract = {It has been proposed that two events of duplication of the entire genome occurred early in vertebrate history (2R hypothesis). Several phylogenetic studies with a few gene families (mostly Hox genes and proteins from the {MHC}) have tried to confirm these polyploidization events. However, data from a single locus cannot explain the evolutionary history of a complete genome. To study this 2R hypothesis, we have taken advantage of the phylogenetic position of the lamprey to study the history of gene duplications in vertebrates. We selected most gene families that contain several paralogous genes in vertebrates and for which lamprey genes and an out-group are known in databases. In addition, we isolated members of the nuclear receptor superfamily in lamprey. Hagfish genes were also analyzed and found to confirm the lamprey gene analysis. Consistent with the 2R hypothesis, the phylogenetic analysis of 33 selected gene families, dispersed through the whole genome, revealed that one period of gene duplication arose before the lamprey-gnathostome split and this was followed by a second period of gene duplication after the lamprey-gnathostome split. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that numerous gene losses and other gene-genome duplications occurred during the evolution of the vertebrate genomes. Thus, the complexity of all the paralogy groups present in vertebrates should be explained by the contribution of genome duplications (2R hypothesis), extra gene duplications, and gene losses.},

The success of angiosperms has been attributed, in part, to innovations associated with gene or whole-genome duplications, but evidence for proposed ancient genome duplications pre-dating the divergence of monocots and eudicots remains equivocal in analyses of conserved gene order. Here we use comprehensive phylogenomic analyses of sequenced plant genomes and more than 12.6 million new expressed-sequence-tag sequences from phylogenetically pivotal lineages to elucidate two groups of ancient gene duplications—one in the common ancestor of extant seed plants and the other in the common ancestor of extant angiosperms. Gene duplication events were intensely concentrated around 319 and 192 million years ago, implicating two {WGDs} in ancestral lineages shortly before the diversification of extant seed plants and extant angiosperms, respectively. Significantly, these ancestral {WGDs} resulted in the diversification of regulatory genes important to seed and flower development, suggesting that they were involved in major innovations that ultimately contributed to the rise and eventual dominance of seed plants and angiosperms.},

	abstract = {Over 3,000 human diseases are known to be linked to heritable genetic variation, mapping to over 1,700 unique genes. Dating of the evolutionary age of these disease-associated genes has suggested that they have a tendency to be ancient, specifically coming into existence with early metazoa. The approach taken by past studies, however, assumes that the age of a disease is the same as the age of its common ancestor, ignoring the fundamental contribution of duplication events in the evolution of new genes and function. Here, we date both the common ancestor and the duplication history of known human disease-associated genes. We find that the majority of disease genes (80\%) are genes that have been duplicated in their evolutionary history. Periods for which there are more disease-associated genes, for example, at the origins of bony vertebrates, are explained by the emergence of more genes at that time, and the majority of these are duplicates inferred to have arisen by whole-genome duplication. These relationships are similar for different disease types and the disease-associated gene's cellular function. This indicates that the emergence of duplication-associated diseases has been ongoing and approximately constant (relative to the retention of duplicate genes) throughout the evolution of life. This continued until approximately 390 Ma from which time relatively fewer novel genes came into existence on the human lineage, let alone disease genes. For single-copy genes associated with disease, we find that the numbers of disease genes decreases with recency. For the majority of duplicates, the disease-associated mutation is associated with just one of the duplicate copies. A universal explanation for heritable disease is, thus, that it is merely a by-product of the evolutionary process; the evolution of new genes (de novo or by duplication) results in the potential for new diseases to emerge.},

An individual (genotype {ACAGATATA}) produces offspring with a chance of error during {DNA} replication (mutation) at each generation, showing that random changes in ancestral genotypes may reflect on descendant phenotypes. Methods The game has three steps: (1) construction of a dichotomous diagram by submission of the parental {DNA} to successive copies in which the chance of mutation is dictated by special roulettes. After three generations, up to eight different {DNA} sequences could appear; (2) attribution of amino acids series to the eight nucleotide sequences in the third generation, following the genetic code; and (3) analysis of traits in these individuals and scoring of outcomes. To measure {ACAGATATA}’s effect on learning, undergraduate students answered true-or-false questions before and after the game. Results In the tests, global scores after {ACAGATATA} were higher than before. Performance increased significantly in ten questions. Questions without direct connection to the game exhibited no significant change in performance. Satisfaction with the game was confirmed by high values in two questions asking the students about the contribution of {ACAGATATA} to their knowledge on the role of mutation in evolution. Conclusions {ACAGATATA} is suitable for biology courses concerning genetic information, its expression and molecular evolution, allowing an increase in student performance on these issues.

	abstract = {Summary
The predictability of evolution is debatable, with recent evidence suggesting that outcomes may be constrained by gene interaction networks [1]. Whole-genome duplication ({WGD}; polyploidization—ubiquitous in plant evolution [2]) provides the opportunity to evaluate the predictability of genome reduction, a pervasive feature of evolution [3, 4]. Repeated patterns of genome reduction appear to have occurred via duplicated gene (homeolog) loss in divergent species following ancient {WGD} [5–9], with evidence for preferential retention of duplicates in certain gene classes [8–10]. The speed at which these patterns arise is unknown. We examined presence/absence of 70 homeologous loci in 59 Tragopogon miscellus plants from five natural populations of independent origin; this allotetraploid arose ∼80 years ago via hybridization between diploid parents and {WGD} [11]. Genes were repeatedly retained or lost in clusters, and the gene ontology categories of the missing genes correspond to those lost after ancient {WGD} in the same family (Asteraceae; sunflower family) [6] and with gene dosage sensitivity [8]. These results provide evidence that the outcomes of {WGD} are predictable, even in 40 generations, perhaps due to the connectivity of gene products [8, 10, 12]. The high frequency of single-allele losses detected and low frequency of changes fixed within populations provide evidence for ongoing evolution.},

The regulatory sequences that control the expression of such terminal gene batteries in individual neurons is largely unknown. The existence of a complete genome sequence for C. elegans and draft genomes of other nematodes let us use comparative genomics to identify regulatory sequences directing expression in the {DVA} interneuron.Methodology/Principal {FindingsUsing} phylogenetic comparisons of multiple Caenorhabditis species, we identified conserved non-coding sequences in 3 of 10 genes (fax-1, nmr-1, and twk-16) that direct expression of reporter transgenes in {DVA} and other neurons. The conserved region and flanking sequences in an 85-bp intronic region of the twk-16 gene directs highly restricted expression in {DVA}. Mutagenesis of this 85 bp region shows that it has at least four regions. The central 53 bp region contains a 29 bp region that represses expression and a 24 bp region that drives broad neuronal expression. Two short flanking regions restrict expression of the twk-16 gene to {DVA}. A shared {GA}-rich motif was identified in three of these genes but had opposite effects on expression when mutated in the nmr-1 and twk-16 {DVA} regulatory elements.Conclusions/{SignificanceWe} identified by multi-species conservation regulatory regions within three genes that direct expression in the {DVA} neuron. We identified four contiguous regions of sequence of the twk-16 gene enhancer with positive and negative effects on expression, which combined to restrict expression to the {DVA} neuron. For this neuron a single binding site may thus not achieve sufficient specificity for cell specific expression. One of the positive elements, an 8-bp sequence required for expression was identified in silico by sequence comparisons of seven nematode species, demonstrating the potential resolution of expanded multi-species phylogenetic comparisons.},

The factors underlying this variation are, however, still poorly understood. In the last decade, the position of proteins in the protein–protein interaction network has been put forward as a determinant factor of the evolutionary rate and duplicability of their encoding genes. This conclusion, however, has been based on the analysis of the limited number of microbes and animals for which interactome-level data are available (essentially, Escherichia coli, yeast, worm, fly, and humans). Here, we study, for the first time, the relationship between the position of proteins in the high-density interactome of a plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) and the patterns of molecular evolution of their encoding genes. We found that genes whose encoded products act at the center of the network are more evolutionarily constrained than those acting at the network periphery. This trend remains significant when potential confounding factors (gene expression level and breadth, duplicability, function, and length of the encoded products) are controlled for. Even though the correlation between centrality measures and rates of evolution is generally weak, for some functional categories, it is comparable in strength to (or even stronger than) the correlation between evolutionary rates and expression levels or breadths. In addition, genes encoding interacting proteins in the network evolve at relatively similar rates. Finally, Arabidopsis proteins encoded by duplicated genes are more highly connected than those encoded by singleton genes. This observation is in agreement with the patterns observed in humans, but in contrast with those observed in E. coli, yeast, worm, and fly (whose duplicated genes tend to act at the periphery of the network), implying that the relationship between duplicability and centrality inverted at least twice during eukaryote evolution. Taken together, these results indicate that the structure of the A. thaliana network constrains the evolution of its components at multiple levels.},

	abstract = {Background Genome reduction is a common evolutionary process affecting bacterial lineages that establish symbiotic or pathogenic associations with eukaryotic hosts. Such associations yield highly reduced genomes with greatly streamlined metabolic abilities shaped by the type of ecological association with the host. Sodalis glossinidius, the secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies, represents one of the few complete genomes available of a bacterium at the initial stages of this process. In the present study, genome reduction is studied from a systems biology perspective through the reconstruction and functional analysis of genome-scale metabolic networks of S. glossinidius. Results The functional profile of ancestral and extant metabolic networks sheds light on the evolutionary events underlying transition to a host-dependent lifestyle. Meanwhile, reductive evolution simulations on the extant metabolic network can predict possible future evolution of S. glossinidius in the context of genome reduction. Finally, knockout simulations in different metabolic systems reveal a gradual decrease in network robustness to different mutational events for bacterial endosymbionts at different stages of the symbiotic association. Conclusions Stoichiometric analysis reveals few gene inactivation events whose effects on the functionality of S. glossinidius metabolic systems are drastic enough to account for the ecological transition from a free-living to host-dependent lifestyle. The decrease in network robustness across different metabolic systems may be associated with the progressive integration in the more stable environment provided by the insect host. Finally, reductive evolution simulations reveal the strong influence that external conditions exert on the evolvability of metabolic systems.},

Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and other related nematode species as a starting point, we describe here a bioinformatic pipeline that identifies potential transcription factor target genes from genomic sequences. Among the key features of this pipeline is the use of sequence conservation of transcription factor binding sites in related species. Rather than using aligned genomic {DNA} sequences from the genomes of multiple species as a starting point, {TargetOrtho} scans related genome sequences independently for matches to user-provided transcription factor binding motifs, assigns motif matches to adjacent genes and then determines whether orthologous genes in different species also contain motif matches. We validate {TargetOrtho} by identifying previously characterized targets of a set of three different types of transcription factors in C. elegans and we use {TargetOrtho} to identify novel target genes of the {COE}-type transcription factor {UNC}-3 in C. elegans ventral nerve cord motor neurons. We have also implemented the use of {TargetOrtho} in Drosophila melanogaster using conservation among five species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup for target gene discovery.},

This suggests that the common ancestor of eumetazoans already had a highly complex gene repertoire. At present it is therefore unclear how morphological diversification is encoded in the genome. Here we address the possibility that differences in gene regulation could contribute to the large morphological divergence between cnidarians and bilaterians. To this end, we generated the first genome-wide map of gene regulatory elements in a nonbilaterian animal, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing of five chromatin modifications and a transcriptional cofactor, we identified over 5000 enhancers in the Nematostella genome and could validate 75\% of the tested enhancers in vivo. We found that in Nematostella, but not in yeast, enhancers are characterized by the same combination of histone modifications as in bilaterians, and these enhancers preferentially target developmental regulatory genes. Surprisingly, the distribution and abundance of gene regulatory elements relative to these genes are shared between Nematostella and bilaterian model organisms. Our results suggest that complex gene regulation originated at least 600 million yr ago, predating the common ancestor of eumetazoans.},

Thirteen new programs have been added to the 30 described in the 2008 {NAR} Web Software Issue, including an automated sequence retrieval from {EnsEMBL} (retrieve-ensembl-seq), two novel motif discovery algorithms (oligo-diff and info-gibbs), a 100-times faster version of matrix-scan enabling the scanning of genome-scale sequence sets, and a series of facilities for random model generation and statistical evaluation (random-genome-fragments, random-motifs, random-sites, implant-sites, sequence-probability, permute-matrix). Our most recent work also focused on motif comparison (compare-matrices) and evaluation of motif quality (matrix-quality) by combining theoretical and empirical measures to assess the predictive capability of position-specific scoring matrices. To process large collections of peak sequences obtained from {ChIP}-seq or related technologies, {RSAT} provides a new program (peak-motifs) that combines several efficient motif discovery algorithms to predict transcription factor binding motifs, match them against motif databases and predict their binding sites.

	abstract = {Many insects rely on symbiotic microbes for survival, growth, or reproduction. Over evolutionary timescales, the association with intracellular symbionts is stabilized by partner fidelity through strictly vertical symbiont transmission, resulting in congruent host and symbiont phylogenies. However, little is known about how symbioses with extracellular symbionts, representing the majority of insect-associated microorganisms, evolve and remain stable despite opportunities for horizontal exchange and de novo acquisition of symbionts from the environment. Here we demonstrate that host control over symbiont transmission (partner choice) reinforces partner fidelity between solitary wasps and antibiotic-producing bacteria and thereby stabilizes this Cretaceous-age defensive mutualism. Phylogenetic analyses show that three genera of beewolf wasps (Philanthus, Trachypus, and Philanthinus) cultivate a distinct clade of Streptomyces bacteria for protection against pathogenic fungi. The symbionts were acquired from a soil-dwelling ancestor at least 68 million years ago, and vertical transmission via the brood cell and the cocoon surface resulted in host–symbiont codiversification. However, the external mode of transmission also provides opportunities for horizontal transfer, and beewolf species have indeed exchanged symbiont strains, possibly through predation or nest reuse. Experimental infection with nonnative bacteria reveals that—despite successful colonization of the antennal gland reservoirs—transmission to the cocoon is selectively blocked. Thus, partner choice can play an important role even in predominantly vertically transmitted symbioses by stabilizing the cooperative association over evolutionary timescales.},

	abstract = {Gene duplication plays an important role in the evolution of genomes and interactomes. Elucidating how evolution after gene duplication interplays at the sequence and network level is of great interest. In this work, we analyze a data set of gene pairs that arose through whole-genome duplication ({WGD}) in yeast. All these pairs have the same duplication time, making them ideal for evolutionary investigation. We investigated the interplay between evolution after {WGD} at the sequence and network levels and correlated these two levels of divergence with gene expression and fitness data. We find that molecular interactions involving {WGD} genes evolve at rates that are three orders of magnitude slower than the rates of evolution of the corresponding sequences. Furthermore, we find that divergence of {WGD} pairs correlates strongly with gene expression and fitness data. Because of the role of gene duplication in determining redundancy in biological systems and particularly at the network level, we investigated the role of interaction networks in elucidating the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes. We find that gene neighborhoods in interaction networks provide a mechanism for inferring these fates, and we developed an algorithm for achieving this task. Further epistasis analysis of {WGD} pairs categorized by their inferred evolutionary fates demonstrated the utility of these techniques. Finally, we find that {WGD} pairs and other pairs of paralogous genes of small-scale duplication origin share similar properties, giving good support for generalizing our results from {WGD} pairs to evolution after gene duplication in general.},

We sampled in five successional stages on the island of Hiddensee, Germany. Species richness of carabids and spiders and Simpson diversity for spiders did not differ among stages. Functional dispersion ({FDis}), a measure of functional richness, was lowest in the youngest stage for both carabids and spiders. Older successional stages represent more heterogeneous habitats and offer a broader range of niches, which might enhance functional dispersion. Functional evenness ({FEve}) differed among successional stages for spiders, indicating an uneven distribution of species abundances in the functional trait space. Functional divergence ({FDiv}) did not differ among stages for either taxon. Shifts in life-history traits were noted in both arthropod groups, but not always in the same direction: Body size of carabid beetles increased towards older successional stages, but decreased for spiders. The number of flightless carabid species increased towards older habitats. Each successional stage seemingly favors species with distinct life-history traits (species sorting). We conclude that a trait-based approach including the use of functional diversity measurements ({FDis}) could contribute valuable information for biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Background
The genome of Paramecium tetraurelia, a unicellular model that belongs to the ciliate phylum, has been shaped by at least 3 successive whole genome duplications ({WGD}). These dramatic events, which have also been documented in plants, animals and fungi, are resolved over evolutionary time by the loss of one duplicate for the majority of genes. Thanks to a low rate of large scale genome rearrangement in Paramecium, an unprecedented large number of gene duplicates of different ages have been identified, making this organism an outstanding model to investigate the evolutionary consequences of polyploidization. The most recent {WGD}, with 51\% of pre-duplication genes still in 2 copies, provides a snapshot of a phase of rapid gene loss that is not accessible in more ancient polyploids such as yeast.

Results
We designed a custom oligonucleotide microarray platform for P. tetraurelia genome-wide expression profiling and used the platform to measure gene expression during 1) the sexual cycle of autogamy, 2) growth of new cilia in response to deciliation and 3) biogenesis of secretory granules after massive exocytosis. Genes that are differentially expressed during these time course experiments have expression patterns consistent with a very low rate of subfunctionalization (partition of ancestral functions between duplicated genes) in particular since the most recent polyploidization event.

Conclusions
A public transcriptome resource is now available for Paramecium tetraurelia. The resource has been integrated into the {ParameciumDB} model organism database, providing searchable access to the data. The microarray platform, freely available through {NimbleGen} Systems, provides a robust, cost-effective approach for genome-wide expression profiling in P. tetraurelia. The expression data support previous studies showing that at short evolutionary times after a whole genome duplication, gene dosage balance constraints and not functional change are the major determinants of gene retention.},

	abstract = {Solid semi-crystalline starch and hydrosoluble glycogen define two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide. Appearance of semi-crystalline storage polysaccharides appears linked to the requirement of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria to fuel nitrogenase and protect it from oxygen through respiration of vast amounts of stored carbon. Starch metabolism itself resulted from the merging of the bacterial and eukaryote pathways of storage polysaccharide metabolism after endosymbiosis of the plastid. This generated the three Archaeplastida lineages: the green algae and land plants (Chloroplastida), the red algae (Rhodophyceae), and the glaucophytes (Glaucophyta). Reconstruction of starch metabolism in the common ancestor of Archaeplastida suggests that polysaccharide synthesis was ancestrally cytosolic. In addition, the synthesis of cytosolic starch from the {ADP}-glucose exported from the cyanobacterial symbiont possibly defined the original metabolic flux by which the cyanobiont provided photosynthate to its host. Additional evidence supporting this scenario include the monophyletic origin of the major carbon translocators of the inner membrane of eukaryote plastids which are sisters to nucleotide-sugar transporters of the eukaryote endomembrane system. It also includes the extent of enzyme subfunctionalization that came as a consequence of the rewiring of this pathway to the chloroplasts in the green algae. Recent evidence suggests that, at the time of endosymbiosis, obligate intracellular energy parasites related to extant Chlamydia have donated important genes to the ancestral starch metabolism network.},

Ice formation is a major variable affecting the survival of both freshwater fauna and fauna inhabiting lichens, mosses and leaf litter. Tardigrades occupy a wide range of niches in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. The highest number of species is found in terrestrial habitats thanks to their ability to enter anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis. The cryobiotic ability of tardigrade species from polar regions is well known. Consequently, we focused our research on the ability to survive freezing in the active hydrated state using seven tardigrade species differing in phylogenetic position and collected at various altitudes and from different habitats in a temperate area. Specimens were cooled at different cooling rates (from 0.31 °C min−1 to 3.26 °C min−1). Even though the final survival and the time required by animals to recover to active life were both inversely related to the cooling rate, highly significant interspecific differences were found. Species survival ability ranged from excellent to none. Species living in xeric habitats withstood freezing better than those living in hygrophilous habitats, while true limnic species did not exhibit any cryobiotic ability. The ability to withstand freezing seems linked to the anhydrobiotic ability. The differences in cryptobiotic performance among tardigrade species seem more influenced by selective pressures linked to local adaptation to habitat characteristics than by phylogenetic relationships.},

Fish genomes provide an ideal context in which to examine the consequences of {WGD}, because the teleost lineage experienced an additional {WGD} soon after divergence from tetrapods and because five teleost genomes are available for comparative analysis. Here we present an integrated approach to characterize these post-duplication genomes based on genome-scale synteny, phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial gene expression and on protein sequence data. A minimum of 3\%–4\% of protein-coding loci have been retained in two copies in each of the five fish genomes, and many of these duplicates are key developmental genes that function as transcription factors or signaling molecules. Almost all duplicate gene pairs we examined have diverged in spatial and/or temporal expression during embryogenesis. A quarter of duplicate pairs have diverged in function via the acquisition of novel protein domains or via changes in the subcellular localization of their encoded proteins. We compared the spatial expression and protein domain architecture of zebrafish {WGD}-duplicates to those of their single mouse ortholog and found many examples supporting a model of neofunctionalization. {WGD}-duplicates have acquired novel protein domains more often than have single-copy genes. Post-{WGD} changes at the gene regulatory level were more common than changes at the protein level. We conclude that the most significant consequence of {WGD} for vertebrate evolution has been to enable more-specialized regulatory control of development via the acquisition of novel spatiotemporal expression domains. We find limited evidence that reciprocal gene loss led to reproductive isolation and speciation in this lineage.},

	abstract = {Author Summary When our body's internal timekeeping system becomes misaligned with the time of day in the outside world, many negative effects can be felt, including decreased performance, improper sleep, and jet lag. When misalignment is prolonged, it can also lead to serious medical conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and possibly even late-onset diabetes. Rapid readjustment of our internal daily (circadian) clock by properly timed exposure to light, which is the strongest signal to our internal circadian clock, is therefore important to the large proportion of the population which suffers from misalignment, including transmeridian travelers, shift workers, and individuals with circadian disorders. Here we develop a methodology to determine schedules of light exposure which may shift the human circadian clock in the minimum time. By calculating thousands of schedules, we show how the human circadian pacemaker is predicted to be capable of shifting much more rapidly than previously thought, simply by adjusting the timing of the beginning and end of each day. Schedules are summarized into general principles of optimal shifting, which can be applied without knowledge of the schedules themselves.},

	abstract = {Genomes, like crazy patchwork quilts, are stitched together over evolutionary time from diverse elements, including some unwelcome invaders. To deal with parasitic mobile elements, most eukaryotes employ a genome self-defensive manoeuvre to recognise and silence such elements by homology-dependent interactions with {RNA}–protein complexes that alter chromatin. Ciliated protozoa employ more ‘offensive’ tactics by actually unstitching and reassembling their somatic genomes at every sexual generation to eliminate transposons and their remnants, using as patterns the maternal genomes that were rearranged in the previous cycle. Genetic and genomic studies of the distant relatives Paramecium and Tetrahymena have begun to reveal how such events are carried out with remarkable precision. Whole genome, non-coding transcripts from the maternal genome are compared with transcripts from the zygotic genome that are processed through an {RNA} interference ({RNAi})-related process. Sequences found only in the latter are targeted for elimination by the resulting short ‘{scanRNAs}’ in many thousand {DNA} splicing reactions initiated by a domesticated transposase. The involvement of widely conserved mechanisms and protein factors clearly shows the relatedness of these phenomena to {RNAi}-mediated heterochromatic gene silencing. Such malleability of the genome on a generational time scale also has profound evolutionary implications, possibly including the epigenetic inheritance of acquired adaptive traits.},

In this manner the cell adjusts to heat, osmotic pressures and other circumstances during its lifetime. Over long timescales, the network of interacting genes and its regulatory actions also undergo evolutionary adaptation. Yet how do such networks evolve and become adapted?In this paper we describe the study of a simple model of gene regulatory networks, focusing solely on evolutionary adaptation. We let a population of individuals evolve, while the external environment changes through time. To ensure evolution is the only source of adaptation, we do not provide the individuals with a sensor to the environment. We show that the interplay between the long-term process of evolution and short-term gene regulation dynamics leads to a striking increase in the efficiency of creating well-adapted offspring. Beneficial mutations become more frequent, nevertheless robustness to the majority of mutations is maintained. Thus we demonstrate a clear example of the evolution of evolvability.},

Abstract
Biological invasions are a global and increasing threat to the function and diversity of ecosystems. Allee effects (positive density dependence) have been shown to play an important role in the establishment and spread of non-native species. Although Allee effects can be considered a bane in conservation efforts, they can be a benefit in attempts to manage non-native species. Many biological invaders are subject to some form of an Allee effect, whether due to a need to locate mates, cooperatively feed or reproduce or avoid becoming a meal, yet attempts to highlight the specific exploitation of Allee effects in biological invasions are surprisingly unprecedented. In this review, we highlight current strategies that effectively exploit an Allee effect, and propose novel means by which Allee effects can be manipulated to the detriment of biological invaders. We also illustrate how the concept of Allee effects can be integral in risk assessments and in the prioritization of resources allocated to manage non-native species, as some species beset by strong Allee effects could be less successful as invaders. We describe how tactics that strengthen an existing Allee effect or create new ones could be used to manage biological invasions more effectively.},

For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The {STRING} database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering {\textgreater}1100 organisms. Here, we describe the update to version 9.1 of {STRING}, introducing several improvements: (i) we extend the automated mining of scientific texts for interaction information, to now also include full-text articles; (ii) we entirely re-designed the algorithm for transferring interactions from one model organism to the other; and (iii) we provide users with statistical information on any functional enrichment observed in their networks.},

Here, we focus on several mechanisms that mediate gene dosage effects and analyze biochemical interactions among multiple gene products that are sources of nonlinear relations connecting genotypes and phenotypes. We also explore potential mechanisms that compensate for gene dosage effects. Understanding these issues is critical to understanding why an individual bearing a few damaging mutations can be severely diseased, whereas others harboring tens of potentially deleterious mutations can appear quite healthy.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

	abstract = {The recent determination of the genetic basis for the biosynthesis of the neurotoxin, saxitoxin, produced by cyanobacteria, has revealed a highly complex sequence of reactions, involving over 30 biosynthetic steps encoded by up to 26 genes clustered at one genomic locus, sxt. Insights into evolutionary–ecological processes have been found through the study of such secondary metabolites because they consist of a measurable phenotype with clear ecological consequences, synthesized by known genes in a small number of species. However, the processes involved in and timing of the divergence of prokaryotic secondary metabolites have been difficult to determine due to their antiquity and the possible frequency of horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination. Through analyses of gene synteny, phylogenies of individual genes, and analyses of recombination and selection, we identified the evolutionary processes of this cluster in five species of cyanobacteria. Here, we provide evidence that the sxt cluster appears to have been largely vertically inherited and was therefore likely present early in the divergence of the Nostocales, at least 2,100 Ma, the earliest reliably dated appearance of a secondary metabolite. The sxt cluster has been extraordinarily conserved through stabilizing selection. Genes have been lost and rearranged, have undergone intra- and interspecific recombination, and have been subject to duplication followed by positive selection along the duplicated lineage, with likely consequences for the toxin analogues produced. Several hypotheses exist as to the ecophysiological role of saxitoxin: as a method of chemical defense, cellular nitrogen storage, {DNA} metabolism, or chemical signaling. The antiquity of this gene cluster indicates that potassium channels, not sodium channels, may have been the original targets of this compound. The extraordinary conservation of the machinery for saxitoxin synthesis, under radically changing environmental conditions, shows that it has continued to play an important adaptive role in some cyanobacteria.},

Its output may be uploaded to our web-based visualization tool ({SHARKview}) for exploring and comparing data from different organisms. We first demonstrate the utility of the software by comparing its results for the raw Plasmodium falciparum genome with the manual annotations available at the {PlasmoDB} and {PlasmoCyc} websites. We then apply {SHARKhunt} to the unannotated genome sequences of the coccidian parasite Eimeria tenella and observe that, at an E-value cut-off of 10−20, our software makes 142 additional assertions of enzymatic function compared with a recent annotation package working with translated open reading frame sequences. The ability of the software to cope with low levels of sequence coverage is investigated by analyzing assemblies of the E.tenella genome at estimated coverages from 0.5× to 7.5×. Lastly, as an example of how {metaSHARK} can be used to evaluate the genomic evidence for specific metabolic pathways, we present a study of coenzyme A biosynthesis in P.falciparum and E.tenella.},

Researchers are often interested in identifying the processes responsible for such change. Although there is well developed demographic theory to explain time series of population size, equivalent theory does not exist for the mean values of phenotypic traits in structured populations. We derive an equation to exactly decompose change in the mean value of a phenotypic trait into contributions from fluctuations in the demographic structure, and age-specific viability selection, fertility selection, growth and reversion and differences between offspring and parental trait values. We calculate these contributions to fluctuations in mean birth weight in a well characterized population of red deer. Over the {\textgreater} 30 years of the study mean birth weight has not significantly changed. Stasis has occurred because positive viability selection for an increase in birth weight is countered by transmission bias. Our derivation demonstrates that this is only one of many ways in which equilibria in the mean value of a phenotypic trait can be maintained. The age-structured Price equation we derive and apply has the potential to provide considerable insight into the processes generating now frequently reported cases of rapid phenotypic change.},

Here we show that in the unicellular eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia, a ciliate, most of the nearly 40,000 genes arose through at least three successive whole-genome duplications. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the most recent duplication coincides with an explosion of speciation events that gave rise to the P. aurelia complex of 15 sibling species. We observed that gene loss occurs over a long timescale, not as an initial massive event. Genes from the same metabolic pathway or protein complex have common patterns of gene loss, and highly expressed genes are over-retained after all duplications. The conclusion of this analysis is that many genes are maintained after whole-genome duplication not because of functional innovation but because of gene dosage constraints.},

Population differentiation for both phenological traits was observed with high-altitude populations germinating and flushing later than low altitude ones. However, high genetic variation and heritability values were also maintained within populations, despite slightly decreasing for dates of leaf unfolding with increasing altitude. We suggest that biotic and abiotic fluctuating selection pressures within populations and high gene flow are the main mechanisms maintaining high genetic variation for these fitness related traits. Moreover, changes in selection intensity and/or selection pressures along the altitudinal gradient can explain the reduction in genetic variation observed for leaf phenology. We anticipate that the maintenance of high genetic variation will be a valuable resource for future adaptation of sessile oak populations undergoing an upslope shift caused by climate change.},

	abstract = {Motivation: We present an integrated toolkit, {BoBro}2.0, for prediction and analysis of cis-regulatory motifs. This toolkit can (i) reliably identify statistically significant cis-regulatory motifs at a genome scale; (ii) accurately scan for all motif instances of a query motif in specified genomic regions using a novel method for P-value estimation; (iii) provide highly reliable comparisons and clustering of identified motifs, which takes into consideration the weak signals from the flanking regions of the motifs; and (iv) analyze co-occurring motifs in the regulatory regions.
Results: We have carried out systematic comparisons between motif predictions using {BoBro}2.0 and the {MEME} package. The comparison results on Escherichia coli K12 genome and the human genome show that {BoBro}2.0 can identify the statistically significant motifs at a genome scale more efficiently, identify motif instances more accurately and get more reliable motif clusters than {MEME}. In addition, {BoBro}2.0 provides correlational analyses among the identified motifs to facilitate the inference of joint regulation relationships of transcription factors.

Traditionally, polyploidy has been considered an evolutionary dead end, whereas recent genomic studies suggest that polyploidy has been a key driver of macroevolutionary success. We examined the consequences of polyploidy on the time scale of genera across a diverse set of vascular plants, encompassing hundreds of inferred polyploidization events. Likelihood-based analyses indicate that polyploids generally exhibit lower speciation rates and higher extinction rates than diploids, providing the first quantitative corroboration of the dead-end hypothesis. The increased speciation rates of diploids can, in part, be ascribed to their capacity to speciate via polyploidy. Only particularly fit lineages of polyploids may persist to enjoy longer-term evolutionary success.},

	abstract = {Detection of rare events happening in a set of {DNA}/protein sequences could lead to new biological discoveries. One kind of such rare events is the presence of patterns called motifs in {DNA}/protein sequences. Finding motifs is a challenging problem since the general version of motif search has been proven to be intractable. Motifs discovery is an important problem in biology. For example, it is useful in the detection of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional regulatory elements that are very crucial in understanding gene function, human disease, drug design, etc. Many versions of the motif search problem have been proposed in the literature. One such is the -motif search (or Planted Motif Search ({PMS})). A generalized version of the {PMS} problem, namely, Quorum Planted Motif Search ({qPMS}), is shown to accurately model motifs in real data. However, solving the {qPMS} problem is an extremely difficult task because a special case of it, the {PMS} Problem, is already {NP}-hard, which means that any algorithm solving it can be expected to take exponential time in the worse case scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named {qPMS}7 that tackles the {qPMS} problem on real data as well as challenging instances. Experimental results show that our Algorithm {qPMS}7 is on an average 5 times faster than the state-of-art algorithm. The executable program of Algorithm {qPMS}7 is freely available on the web at http://pms.engr.uconn.edu/downloads/{qPMS}7.zip. Our online motif discovery tools that use Algorithm {qPMS}7 are freely available at http://pms.engr.uconn.edu or http://motifsearch.com.},

	abstract = {Author Summary{\textless}p{\textgreater}Senescent aging is an irreversible deterioration in physiological condition with age, which many organisms express even when removed from harmful environmental influences. The inevitability of senescence for repeatedly reproducing organisms has well-developed theoretical foundations. Since reproduction carries physiological costs, natural selection in a hazardous environment favors reaping early benefits, and delaying the cost in physiological decline until later in life when there is a greater chance of being dead from exogenous factors. But some organisms show negligible senescence, and a few, such as {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Hydra{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and the Bristlecone Pine, appear to have indefinite lifespans. We ask how such species could have evolved from ancestors with senescent life histories. In large populations, juveniles attempting recruitment into the adult population can be “crowded out” by already established adults. We show how this phenomenon can trigger a process of runaway selection on ever-reducing senescence, which can even result in the evolution of intrinsic immortality. Contrary to previous hypotheses, we find the rate of senescence to be insensitive to environmental hazard, which instead influences background, age-independent rates of physiological decline.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

Such similarity-search functionality is expected to facilitate the identification of transcription factors that potentially interact with newly discovered motifs. {STAMP} also automatically builds multiple alignments, familial binding profiles and similarity trees when more than one motif is inputted. These functions are expected to enable evolutionary studies on sets of related motifs and fixed-order regulatory modules, as well as illustrating similarities and redundancies within the input motif collection. {STAMP} is a highly flexible alignment platform, allowing users to ‘mix-and-match’ between various implemented comparison metrics, alignment methods (local or global, gapped or ungapped), multiple alignment strategies and tree-building methods. Motifs may be inputted as frequency matrices (in many of the commonly used formats), consensus sequences, or alignments of known binding sites. {STAMP} also directly accepts the output files from 12 supported motif-finders, enabling quick interpretation of motif-discovery analyses. {STAMP} is available at http://www.benoslab.pitt.edu/stamp},

Recently, it has become possible to test this notion by searching complete genome sequence for signs of ancient duplication. Here, we show that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arose from ancient whole-genome duplication, by sequencing and analysing Kluyveromyces waltii, a related yeast species that diverged before the duplication. The two genomes are related by a 1:2 mapping, with each region of K. waltii corresponding to two regions of S. cerevisiae, as expected for whole-genome duplication. This resolves the long-standing controversy on the ancestry of the yeast genome, and makes it possible to study the fate of duplicated genes directly. Strikingly, 95\% of cases of accelerated evolution involve only one member of a gene pair, providing strong support for a specific model of evolution, and allowing us to distinguish ancestral and derived functions.},

In this report, we therefore investigated Hsps in tardigrades in the active versus the anhydrobiotic state employing proteomics techniques.

This study indicates the presence of Hsps of the major chaperone families Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90, small Hsps and furthermore nucleotide exchange factors and co-chaperones in Milnesium tardigradum.

	abstract = {Changes in ploidy occurred early in the diversification of some animal and plant lineages and represent an ongoing phenomenon in others. While the prevalence of polyploid lineages indicates that this phenomenon is a common and successful evolutionary transition, whether polyploidization itself has a significant effect on patterns and rates of diversification remains an open question. Here we review evidence for the creative role of polyploidy in evolution. We present new estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in ferns and flowering plants based on a simple model describing transitions between odd and even base chromosome numbers. These new estimates indicate that ploidy changes may represent from 2 to 4\% of speciation events in flowering plants and 7\% in ferns. Speciation via polyploidy is likely to be one of the more predominant modes of sympatric speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes, effects that can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system, and ecological tolerances. Theoretical models support the potential for increased adaptability in polyploid lineages. The evidence suggests that polyploidization can produce shifts in genetic systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence that polyploidy has changed rates and patterns of diversification remains elusive.},

In particular, we compared whole-genome duplication ({WGD}) with small-scale duplication ({SSD}), as well as tissue restricted with ubiquitously expressed genes. All patterns were also analysed in the light of gene evolutionary rates. Among those genes characterized by rapid evolution and expressed in a restricted range of tissues, {SSD} was represented in a larger proportion than {WGD}. Conversely, genes with ubiquitous expression were associated with slower evolutionary rates and a larger proportion of {WGD}. The results also show that evolutionary rates were faster in genes expressed in endodermal tissues and slower in ectodermal genes. Accordingly, the proportion of the {SSD} and {WGD} genes was highest in the endoderm and ectoderm, respectively. Therefore, quickly evolving {SSD} genes might have contributed to the faster evolution of endodermal tissues, whereas the comparatively slowly evolving {WGD} genes might have functioned to maintain the basic characteristics of ectodermal tissues. Mesenchymal tissues occupied an intermediate position in this regard, whereas the patterns observed for haemocytes were unique. Rapid tissue evolution could be related to a specific gene duplication mode ({SSD}) and faster molecular evolution in response to exposure to the external environment. These findings reveal general patterns underlying the evolution of tissues and their corresponding genes.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a breathtaking increase in the availability of genome sequence data, providing evidence of the highly duplicate nature of eukaryotic genomes. Plants are exceptional among eukaryotic organisms in that duplicate loci compose a large fraction of their genomes, partly because of the frequent occurrence of polyploidy (or whole-genome duplication) events. Tandem gene duplication and transposition have also contributed to the large number of duplicated genes in plant genomes. Evolutionary analyses allowed the dynamics of duplicate gene evolution to be studied and several models were proposed. It seems that, over time, many duplicated genes were lost and some of those that were retained gained new functions and/or expression patterns (neofunctionalization) or subdivided their functions and/or expression patterns between them (subfunctionalization). Recent studies have provided examples of genes that originated by duplication with successive diversification within plants. In this review, we focused on the {TEL} ({TERMINAL} {EAR}1-like) genes to illustrate such mechanisms. Emerged from the mei2 gene family, these {TEL} genes are likely to be land plant-specific. Phylogenetic analyses revealed one or two {TEL} copies per diploid genome. {TEL} gene degeneration and loss in several Angiosperm species such as in poplar and maize seem to have occurred. In Arabidopsis thaliana, whose genome experienced at least three polyploidy events followed by massive gene loss and genomic reorganization, two {TEL} genes were retained and two new shorter {TEL}-like ({MCT}) genes emerged. Molecular and expression analyses suggest for these genes sub- and neofunctionalization events, but confirmation will come from their functional characterization.},

Paramecium tetraurelia somatic genome sequencing, reviewed here, has provided insight into the organization and evolution of the genome. A series of at least 3 whole genome duplications was detected in the Paramecium lineage and selective pressures that determine the fate of the gene duplicates analyzed. Variability in the somatic {DNA} was characterized and could be attributed to the genome rearrangement processes. Since, in Paramecium, alternative genome rearrangement patterns can be inherited across sexual generations by homology-dependent epigenetic mechanisms and can affect phenotype, I discuss the possibility that ciliate nuclear dimorphism buffers genetic variation hidden in the germline.},

Hence, the advantages and disadvantages of genome doubling per se compared with genome doubling coupled with hybridizations in allopolyploids remain unclear. Autopolyploids are characterized by genomic redundancy and polysomic inheritance, increasing effective population size. To shed light on the evolutionary consequences of autopolyploidy, we review a broad range of studies focusing on both synthetic and natural autopolyploids encompassing levels of biological organization from genes to evolutionary lineages. The limited evidence currently available suggests that autopolyploids neither experience strong genome restructuring nor wide reorganization of gene expression during the first generations following genome doubling, but that these processes may become more important in the longer term. Biogeographic and ecological surveys point to an association between the formation of autopolyploid lineages and environmental change. We thus hypothesize that polysomic inheritance may provide a short-term evolutionary advantage for autopolyploids compared to diploid relatives when environmental change enforces range shifts. In addition, autopolyploids should possess increased genome flexibility, allowing them to adapt and persist across heterogeneous landscapes in the long run.},

	abstract = {Whole genome duplications ({WGDs}) followed by diploidization, which includes gene loss, have been an important recurrent process in the evolution of higher eukaryotes. Gene retention is biased to specific functional gene categories during diploidization. Dosage-sensitive genes, which include transcription factors, are significantly over-retained following {WGDs}. By contrast, these same functional gene categories exhibit lower retention rates following smaller scale duplications (e.g., local and tandem duplicates, segmental duplicates, aneuploidy). In light of these recent observations, we review current theories that address the fate of nuclear genes following duplication events (i.e., Gain of Function Hypothesis, Subfunctionalization Hypothesis, Increased Gene Dosage Hypothesis, Functional Buffering Model, and the Gene Balance Hypothesis). We broadly review different mechanisms of dosage-compensation that have evolved to alleviate harmful dosage-imbalances. In addition, we examine a recently proposed extension of the Gene Balance Hypothesis to explain the shared single copy status for a specific functional class of genes across the flowering plants. We speculate that the preferential retention of dosage-sensitive genes (e.g., regulatory genes such as transcription factors) and gene loss following {WGDs} has played a significant role in the development of morphological complexity in eukaryotes and facilitating speciation, respectively. Lastly, we will review recent findings that suggest polyploid lineages had increased rates of survival and speciation following mass extinction events, including the Cretaceous-Tertiary ({KT}) extinction.},

They occupy a diversity of niches in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments throughout the world. Some have a cosmopolitan distribution, while others are endemic. About 900 species have been described thus far, but many more species are expected as additional habitats are investigated. Most are less than 1 mm in body length and are opaque or translucent, exhibiting colors such as brown, green, orange, yellow, red, or pink in the cuticle and/or gut. Marine species are more variable in body shape and overall appearance and generally exhibit low population density with high species diversity. Reproductive modes include sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis, but much remains to be known about development. Tardigrades have a hemocoel-type of fluid-filled body cavity, a complete digestive tract, and a lobed dorsal brain with a ventral nerve cord with fused ganglia. Recent molecular analyses and additional morphological studies of the nervous system have confirmed the phylogenetic position of tardigrades as a sister group of the arthropods. The ability of tardigrades to undergo cryptobiosis has long intrigued scientists. Although tardigrades are active only when surrounded by a film of water, they can enter latent states in response to desiccation (anhydrobiosis), temperature (cryobiosis), low oxygen (anoxybiosis), and salinity changes (osmobiosis). Cryptobiotic states aid in dispersal.},

However, detecting orthologous enhancers using alignment-based methods in higher eukaryotic genomes is particularly challenging, as regulatory regions can undergo considerable sequence changes while maintaining their functionality.
Results: We have developed an alignment-free method which identifies conserved enhancers in multiple diverged species. Our method is based on similarity metrics between two sequences based on the co-occurrence of sequence patterns regardless of their order and orientation, thus tolerating sequence changes observed in non-coding evolution. We show that our method is highly successful in detecting orthologous enhancers in distantly related species without requiring additional information such as knowledge about transcription factors involved, or predicted binding sites. By estimating the significance of similarity scores, we are able to discriminate experimentally validated functional enhancers from seemingly equally conserved candidates without function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a wide range of enhancers in Drosophila, and also present encouraging results to detect conserved functional regions across large evolutionary distances. Our work provides encouraging steps on the way to ab initio unbiased enhancer prediction to complement ongoing experimental efforts.

As a result of this event, contemporaneous eukaryotic genomes are chimeras of genes inherited from both endosymbiotic partners. These two coexisting gene repertoires have been shown to differ in a number of ways in yeast. Here we combine genomic and functional data in order to determine if and how human genes that have been inherited from both prokaryotic ancestors remain distinguishable. We show that, despite being fewer in number, human genes of archaebacterial origin are more highly and broadly expressed across tissues, are more likely to have lethal mouse orthologs, tend to be involved in informational processes, are more selectively constrained, and encode shorter and more central proteins in the protein–protein interaction network than eubacterium-like genes. Furthermore, consistent with endosymbiotic theory, we show that proteins tend to interact with those encoded by genes of the same ancestry. Most interestingly from a human health perspective, archaebacterial genes are less likely to be involved in heritable human disease. Taken together, these results show that more than 2 billion years after eukaryogenesis, the human genome retains at least two somewhat distinct communities of genes.},

	abstract = {There are two ways eukaryotes double number of chromosomes: (1) whole genome duplication (polyploidy), in which all nuclear {DNA} is replicated, and (2) karyotypic fission (pseudopolyploidy), in which all chromosomes are physically bifurcated. We contrast polyploidy with pseudopolyploidy, highlighting when it is crucial to look at genetic vs. genomic levels. We review history of pseudopolyploidy, including recent mechanisms by which chromosomal bifurcation may occur and outline methods for detecting such genomic changes. We then delve into the evolutionary implications, with particular focus on adaptive potential, of these two forms of doubling chromosome numbers. We address the common assertion that polyploidy induces adaptive radiations, which contains three fallacies. First, while polyploidy causes quantum speciation, evolutionary theory implies that these radiations should be non-adaptive. Polyploidy causes reproductive isolation, minute effective population sizes, and increased mutation rates, which all imply a diminished role for selection. Second, due to lack of karyotyping in recent decades and lack of distinction between genomic and genetic effects, it is usually impossible to detect pseudopolyploids. Third, pseudopolyploids lack minority cytotype exclusion because they readily backcross with their progenitors, which thereby means no reproductive isolation for newly formed pseudopolyploids. Pseudopolyploidy will thereby not result in radiations until pseudopolyploid descendants undergo subsequent chromosome rearrangements or grow new centromeres. Pseudopolyploids may have a modest selective advantage over their progenitors due to diminished linkage disequilibrium. Thus, pseudopolyploidy may induce adaptive non-radiations. We encourage a renaissance of karyotyping to distinguish between these two mechanisms and a renaissance in genomic perspectives in evolution. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

Eukaryote nuclei thus contain genes of both eubacterial and archaebacterial origins, and these genes have different functions within eukaryotic cells. Here we report that archaebacterium-derived genes are significantly more likely to be essential to yeast viability, are more highly expressed, and are significantly more highly connected and more central in the yeast protein interaction network. These findings hold irrespective of whether the genes have an informational or operational function, so that many features of eukaryotic genes with prokaryotic homologs can be explained by their origin, rather than their function. Taken together, our results show that genes of archaebacterial origin are in some senses more important to yeast metabolism than genes of eubacterial origin. This importance reflects these genes’ origin as the ancestral nuclear component of the eukaryotic genome.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0008938},
	abstract = {Background
Computational de novo discovery of transcription factor binding sites is still a challenging problem. The growing number of sequenced genomes allows integrating orthology evidence with coregulation information when searching for motifs. Moreover, the more advanced motif detection algorithms explicitly model the phylogenetic relatedness between the orthologous input sequences and thus should be well adapted towards using orthologous information. In this study, we evaluated the conditions under which complementing coregulation with orthologous information improves motif detection for the class of probabilistic motif detection algorithms with an explicit evolutionary model.

Methodology
We designed datasets (real and synthetic) covering different degrees of coregulation and orthologous information to test how well Phylogibbs and Phylogenetic sampler, as representatives of the motif detection algorithms with evolutionary model performed as compared to {MEME}, a more classical motif detection algorithm that treats orthologs independently.

Results and Conclusions
Under certain conditions detecting motifs in the combined coregulation-orthology space is indeed more efficient than using each space separately, but this is not always the case. Moreover, the difference in success rate between the advanced algorithms and {MEME} is still marginal. The success rate of motif detection depends on the complex interplay between the added information and the specificities of the applied algorithms. Insights in this relation provide information useful to both developers and users.

	abstract = {The human genome encodes 1500–2000 different transcription factors ({TFs}). {ChIP}-seq is revealing the global binding profiles of a fraction of {TFs} in a fraction of their biological contexts. These data show that the majority of {TFs} bind directly next to a large number of context-relevant target genes, that most binding is distal, and that binding is context specific. Because of the effort and cost involved, {ChIP}-seq is seldom used in search of novel {TF} function. Such exploration is instead done using expression perturbation and genetic screens. Here we propose a comprehensive computational framework for transcription factor function prediction. We curate 332 high-quality nonredundant {TF} binding motifs that represent all major {DNA} binding domains, and improve cross-species conserved binding site prediction to obtain 3.3 million conserved, mostly distal, binding site predictions. We combine these with 2.4 million facts about all human and mouse gene functions, in a novel statistical framework, in search of enrichments of particular motifs next to groups of target genes of particular functions. Rigorous parameter tuning and a harsh null are used to minimize false positives. Our novel {PRISM} (predicting regulatory information from single motifs) approach obtains 2543 {TF} function predictions in a large variety of contexts, at a false discovery rate of 16\%. The predictions are highly enriched for validated {TF} roles, and 45 of 67 (67\%) tested binding site regions in five different contexts act as enhancers in functionally matched cells.},

	abstract = {Mosses are an excellent habitat for tardigrades because of their ability to ensure a high humidity and to provide a rich food supply for both carnivorous and herbivorous species. Food choice can be correlated with the morphology of the buccal apparatus, and consequentially, their distribution is sometimes linked to food availability (nematodes, rotifers, plant cells, algae, yeast and bacteria). In many species, material containing chlorophyll is often observed in the midgut. However, little information has been available until now on the actual food preference of tardigrades. Since trophic interactions within soil food webs are difficult to study, here we use a polymerase chain reaction–based approach as a highly sensitive detection method. The study was carried out to investigate the presence of chlorophyll matter in the gut of active specimens, based on sequence analyses of the chloroplast ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit ({rbcL}) gene from mosses and algae. The sequences found in the gut of Macrobiotus sapiens were derived from the moss families Pottiaceae and Erpodiaceae, in Macrobiotus persimilis and Echiniscus granulatus from the moss family Grimmiaceae, and in Richtersius coronifer from the green algae genus Trebouxia. Furthermore, we show the emission of green autofluorescence from the chloroplasts in the algae within the gut of tardigrades and followed the progress of digestion over a 48-h period. The autofluorescent emission level declined significantly, and after 2 days, the signal level was similar to the level of the starved control.},

In contrast with death, cryptobiosis is a reversible state, and as soon as environmental conditions change, the tardigrade “returns to life.” Cryptobiosis in general, and among the tardigrade in particular, is a phenomenon poorly understood [Guppy, M., 2004.

Moreover, the ability of the tardigrade to bootstrap itself and to return to life seems paradoxical like the legendary Baron von Munchausen who pulled himself out of the swamp by grabbing his own hair. Two theoretical obstacles prevent us from advancing our knowledge of cryptobiosis. First, we lack appropriate theoretical understanding of reversible processes of biological computation in living systems. Second, we lack appropriate theoretical understanding of bootstrapping in living systems. In this short opinion article, I would like to present the idea that although cryptobiosis is obscure from a certain point of view, it makes sense within a scientific perspective suggesting that “organization becomes cause in the matter” [Strohman, R.C., 2000. Organization becomes cause in the matter. Nat. Biotechnol. 18, 575–576]. I present Bateson's idea that organisms have a “recursive hierarchical” form of organization [Neuman, Y., 2004. Meaning making in the immune system. Perspect. Biol. Med. 48, 320–327; Neuman, Y., in press. A theory of meaning. Inform. Sci.] and suggest that this form of organization allows bootstrapping through reversible process of computation as discussed by theoretical physicists [Bennett, C.H., 1982.

Second, studies of opposing selection are informative about mechanisms underlying life history trade-offs. We outline difficulties in measuring opposing selection, particularly the problem that patterns of selection may be masked by the positive effects of nutrition on size of metric traits and fitness components. We discuss some solutions to these problems, and present a statistical technique to help disentangle direct selection from nutritional effects.

	abstract = {In an island population receiving immigrants from a larger continental population, gene flow causes maladaptation, decreasing mean fitness and producing continued directional selection to restore the local mean phenotype to its optimum. We show that this causes higher plasticity to evolve on the island than on the continent at migration-selection equilibrium, assuming genetic variation of reaction norms is such that phenotypic variance is higher on the island, where phenotypes are not canalized. For a species distributed continuously in space along an environmental gradient, higher plasticity evolves at the edges of the geographic range, and in environments where phenotypes are not canalized. Constant or evolving partially adaptive plasticity also alleviates maladaptation owing to gene flow in a heterogeneous environment and produces higher mean fitness and larger population size in marginal populations, preventing them from becoming sinks and facilitating invasion of new habitats. Our results shed light on the widely observed involvement of partially adaptive plasticity in phenotypic clines, and on the mechanisms causing geographic variation in plasticity.},

	abstract = {The green picoalga Ostreococcus is emerging as a simple plant model organism, and two species, O. lucimarinus and O. tauri, have now been sequenced and annotated manually. To evaluate the completeness of the metabolic annotation of both species, metabolic networks of O. lucimarinus and O. tauri were reconstructed from the {KEGG} database, thermodynamically constrained, elementally balanced, and functionally evaluated. The draft networks contained extensive gaps and, in the case of O. tauri, no biomass components could be produced due to an incomplete Calvin cycle. To find and remove gaps from the networks, an extensive reference biochemical reaction database was assembled using a stepwise approach that minimized the inclusion of microbial reactions. Gaps were then removed from both Ostreococcus networks using two existing gap-filling methodologies. In the first method, a bottom-up approach, a minimal list of reactions was added to each model to enable the production of all metabolites included in our biomass equation. In the second method, a top-down approach, all reactions in the reference database were added to the target networks and subsequently trimmed away based on the sequence alignment scores of identified orthologues. Because current gap-filling methods do not produce unique solutions, a quality metric that includes a weighting for phylogenetic distance and sequence similarity was developed to distinguish between gap-filling results automatically. The draft O. lucimarinus and O. tauri networks required the addition of 56 and 70 reactions, respectively, in order to produce the same biomass precursor metabolites that were produced by our plant reference database.},

	abstract = {Chromosome evolution in flowering plants is often punctuated by polyploidy, genome duplication events that fundamentally alter {DNA} content, chromosome number, and gene dosage. Polyploidy confers postzygotic reproductive isolation and is thought to drive ecological divergence and range expansion. The adaptive value of polyploidy, however, remains uncertain; ecologists have traditionally relied on observational methods that cannot distinguish effects of polyploidy per se from genic differences that accumulate after genome duplication. Here I use an experimental approach to test how polyploidy mediates ecological divergence in Achillea borealis (Asteraceae), a widespread tetraploid plant with localized hexaploid populations. In coastal California, tetraploids and hexaploids occupy mesic grassland and xeric dune habitats, respectively. Using field transplant experiments with wild-collected plants, I show that hexaploids have a fivefold fitness advantage over tetraploids in dune habitats. Parallel experiments with neohexaploids—first-generation mutants screened from a tetraploid genetic background—reveal that a 70\% fitness advantage is achieved via genome duplication per se. These results suggest that genome duplication transforms features of A. borealis in a manner that confers adaptation to a novel environment.},

	abstract = {The way in which density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal are key in determining the temporal and spatial dynamics of populations. Here we propose a mechanistic approach to understanding how the relative importance of these sources of density dependence can change over ontogeny through changes in dispersal abilities, energy stores and mortality risks. Whereas the potential for active dispersal typically increases over ontogeny as a function of body size, susceptibility to starvation and predation decreases. The joint effect of these mechanisms suggests a general model for the ontogenetic sequence of how density dependence is manifested, with density dependence early in ontogeny being primarily expressed as mortality on local spatial scales, whereas later stages respond to local density in terms of dispersal and potentially growth. Here we test this model by manipulating the densities of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) at two life-history stages in the wild. Density-dependent mortality during the early juvenile stage (i.e. fry at onset of exogenous feeding) was accompanied by no effects on body size and weak effects on dispersal. In contrast, dispersal of older juveniles (i.e. parr 2–3 months after onset of feeding) was strongly density-dependent, with more individuals emigrating from high-density release sites, and with no effect of initial density on mortality. This dispersal, however, appeared insufficient to produce an ideal free distribution within the study stream, as indicated by the effect of spatial variation in density on body size by the end of the first growth season. These results demonstrate that the way density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal changes throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, these changes occur in correlation with changes in individual mortality risks and dispersal abilities, and suggest a general paradigm for the way in which juvenile density-dependence is manifest in spatially structured populations of highly fecund organisms.},

	abstract = {Because most plants rely on animals for pollination, insights from animal sensory ecology and behavior are essential for understanding the evolution of flowers. In this review, we compare and contrast three main types of pollinator responses to floral signals – receiver bias, ‘adaptive’ innate preferences, and associative learning – and discuss how they can shape selection on floral signals. We show that pollinator-mediated selection on floral signals can be strong and that the molecular bases of floral signal variation are often surprisingly simple. These new empirical and conceptual insights into pollinator-mediated evolution provide a framework for understanding patterns of both convergent (pollination syndromes) and advergent (floral mimicry) floral signal evolution.},

	abstract = {Whole genome duplications ({WGDs}) have been hypothesized to be responsible for major transitions in evolution. However, the effects of {WGD} and subsequent gene loss on cellular behavior and metabolism are still poorly understood. Here we develop a genome scale evolutionary model to study the dynamics of gene loss and metabolic adaptation after {WGD}. Using the metabolic network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an example, we primarily study the outcome of {WGD} on yeast as it currently is. However, similar results were obtained using a recontructed hypothetical metabolic network of the pre-{WGD} ancestor. We show that the retention of genes in duplicate in the model, corresponds nicely with those retained in duplicate after the ancestral {WGD} in S. cerevisiae. Also, we observe that transporter and glycolytic genes have a higher probability to be retained in duplicate after {WGD} and subsequent gene loss, both in the model as in S. cerevisiae, which leads to an increase in glycolytic flux after {WGD}. Furthermore, the model shows that {WGD} leads to better adaptation than small-scale duplications, in environments for which duplication of a whole pathway instead of single reactions is needed to increase fitness. This is indeed the case for adaptation to high glucose levels. Thus, our model confirms the hypothesis that {WGD} has been important in the adaptation of yeast to the new, glucose-rich environment that arose after the appearance of angiosperms. Moreover, the model shows that {WGD} is almost always detrimental on the short term in environments to which the lineage is preadapted, but can have immediate fitness benefits in “new” environments. This explains why {WGD}, while pivotal in the evolution of many lineages and an apparent “easy” genetic operator, occurs relatively rarely.},

	abstract = {Summary 
Ecdysozoans have been key components of ecosystems since the early Cambrian, when trilobites and soft-bodied Burgess Shale-type ecdysozoans dominated marine animal communities [1]. Even today, the most abundant animals on Earth are either nematode worms or plankton-forming crustaceans, whereas the most diverse are the insects [2]. Throughout geological time, several ecdysozoan lineages independently colonized land [3], shaping both marine and terrestrial ecosystems and providing an adequate environment for successive animal terrestrialization. The timing of these events is largely uncertain [4, 5] and has been investigated only partially using molecular data [6–10]. Here we present a timescale of ecdysozoan evolution based on multiple molecular data sets, the most complete set of fossil calibrations to date, and a thorough series of validation analyses. Results converge on an Ediacaran origin of all major ecdysozoan lineages (∼587–543 million years ago [mya]), followed by a fast Cambrian radiation of the pancrustaceans (∼539–511 mya), a Cambro-Ordovician colonization of land of different arthropod lineages (∼510–471 mya), and a relatively recent radiation of extant nematodes, onychophorans, and tardigrades (∼442 mya). Arthropods colonized land nearly synchronously with land plants. Further diversification within flying insects, nematodes and onychophorans might be related to the evolution of vascular plants and forests.},

Improving the understanding of biological systems through mimicry and producing bio-orthogonal systems with new functions are two complementary pursuits in this field. A web server called {FMM} (From Metabolite to Metabolite) was developed for this purpose. {FMM} can reconstruct metabolic pathways form one metabolite to another metabolite among different species, based mainly on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ({KEGG}) database and other integrated biological databases. Novel presentation for connecting different {KEGG} maps is newly provided. Both local and global graphical views of the metabolic pathways are designed. {FMM} has many applications in Synthetic Biology and Metabolic Engineering. For example, the reconstruction of metabolic pathways to produce valuable metabolites or secondary metabolites in bacteria or yeast is a promising strategy for drug production. {FMM} provides a highly effective way to elucidate the genes from which species should be cloned into those microorganisms based on {FMM} pathway comparative analysis. Consequently, {FMM} is an effective tool for applications in synthetic biology to produce both drugs and biofuels.

	url = {http://www.genetics.org/content/134/4/1289},
	abstract = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious mutations.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Comparative genomic sequence analysis is a powerful approach for identifying putative functional elements in silico. The availability of full-genome sequences from many vertebrate species has resulted in the development of popular tools, for example, the {phastCons} software package that search large numbers of genomes to identify conserved elements. While {phastCons} can analyze many genomes simultaneously, it ignores potentially informative insertion and deletion events and relies on a fixed, precomputed multiple sequence alignment.
Results: We have developed a new method, {GRAPeFoot}, which simultaneously aligns two full genomes and annotates a set of conserved regions exhibiting reduced rates of insertion, deletion and substitution mutations. We tested {GRAPeFoot} using the human and mouse genomes and compared its performance to a set of {phastCons} predictions hosted on the {UCSC} genome browser. Our results demonstrate that despite the use of only two genomes, {GRAPeFoot} identified constrained elements at rates comparable with {phastCons}, which analyzed data from 28 vertebrate genomes. This study demonstrates how integrated modelling of substitutions, indels and purifying selection allows a pairwise analysis to exhibit a sensitivity similar to a heuristic analysis of many genomes.

	abstract = {Covariation between population-mean phenotypes and environmental variables, sometimes termed a “phenotype–environment association” ({PEA}), can result from phenotypic plasticity, genetic responses to natural selection, or both. {PEAs} can potentially provide information on the evolutionary dynamics of a particular set of populations, but this requires a full theoretical characterization of {PEAs} and their evolution. Here, we derive formulas for the expected {PEA} in a temporally fluctuating environment for a quantitative trait with a linear reaction norm. We compare several biologically relevant scenarios, including constant versus evolving plasticity, and the situation in which an environment affects both development and selection but at different time periods. We find that {PEAs} are determined not only by biological factors (e.g., magnitude of plasticity, genetic variation), but also environmental factors, such as the association between the environments of development and of selection, and in some cases the level of temporal autocorrelation. We also describe how a {PEA} can be used to estimate the relationship between an optimum phenotype and an environmental variable (i.e., the environmental sensitivity of selection), an important parameter for determining the extinction risk of populations experiencing environmental change. We illustrate this ability using published data on the predator-induced morphological responses of tadpoles to predation risk.},

	abstract = {Homologous recombination is a housekeeping process involved in the maintenance of chromosome integrity and generation of genetic variability. Although detailed biochemical studies have described the mechanism of action of its components in model organisms, there is no recent extensive assessment of this knowledge, using comparative genomics and taking advantage of available experimental data on recombination. Using comparative genomics, we assessed the diversity of recombination processes among bacteria, and simulations suggest that we missed very few homologs. The work included the identification of orthologs and the analysis of their evolutionary history and genomic context. Some genes, for proteins such as {RecA}, the resolvases, and {RecR}, were found to be nearly ubiquitous, suggesting that the large majority of bacterial genomes are capable of homologous recombination. Yet many genomes show incomplete sets of presynaptic systems, with {RecFOR} being more frequent than {RecBCD}/{AddAB}. There is a significant pattern of co-occurrence between these systems and antirecombinant proteins such as the ones of mismatch repair and {SbcB}, but no significant association with nonhomologous end joining, which seems rare in bacteria. Surprisingly, a large number of genomes in which homologous recombination has been reported lack many of the enzymes involved in the presynaptic systems. The lack of obvious correlation between the presence of characterized presynaptic genes and experimental data on the frequency of recombination suggests the existence of still-unknown presynaptic mechanisms in bacteria. It also indicates that, at the moment, the assessment of the intrinsic stability or recombination isolation of bacteria in most cases cannot be inferred from the identification of known recombination proteins in the genomes.},

	abstract = {Using functional genomic and protein structural data we studied the effects of protein complexity (here defined as the number of subunit types in a protein) on gene dispensability and gene duplicability. We found that in terms of gene duplicability the major distinction in protein complexity is between hetero-complexes, each of which includes at least two different types of subunits (polypeptides), and homo-complexes, which include monomers and complexes that consist of only subunits of one polypeptide type. However, gene dispensability decreases only gradually as the number of subunit types in a protein complex increases. These observations suggest that the dosage balance hypothesis can explain well gene duplicability of complex proteins, but cannot completely explain the difference in dispensabilities between hetero-complex subunits. It is likely that knocking out a gene coding for a hetero-complex subunit would disrupt the function of the whole complex, so that the deletion effect on fitness would increase with protein complexity. We also found that multi-domain polypeptide genes are less dispensable but more duplicable than single-domain polypeptide genes. Duplicate genes derived from the whole genome duplication event in yeast are more dispensable (except for ribosomal protein genes) than other duplicate genes. Further, we found that subunits of the same protein complex tend to have similar expression levels and similar effects of gene deletion on fitness. Finally, we estimated that in yeast the contribution of duplicate genes to genetic robustness against null mutation is approximately 9\%, smaller than previously estimated. In yeast, protein complexity may serve as a better indicator of gene dispensability than do duplicate genes.},

	abstract = {One prediction of the classic Ohno model of gene duplication predicts that new genes form from the asymmetric functional divergence of a newly arisen, redundant duplicate locus. In order to understand the mechanisms which give rise to functional divergence of newly formed dispersed duplicates, we assessed the expression and molecular evolutionary divergence of a suite of 19 highly similar dispersed duplicates in Arabidopsis thaliana. These duplicates have a K sil equal to or less than 5 \% and are specific to the A. thaliana lineage; thus, they predictably represent some of the youngest duplicates in the A. thaliana genome. We found that the majority of young duplicate loci exhibit asymmetric expression patterns, with the daughter locus exhibiting reduced expression across all tissues analyzed relative to the progenitor locus or simply not expressed. Furthermore, daughter loci, on the whole, have significantly more nonsynonymous substitutions than the progenitor loci. We also identified four pairs of loci which exhibit significant (P {\textless} 0.05) evolutionary rate asymmetry, three of which exhibit elevated {dN}/{dS} in the duplicate copy. We suggest, based on these data, that functional diversification initially takes the form of asymmetric regulatory divergence that can be a direct consequence of the mode of duplication. The reduced and/or absence of expression in the daughter copy relaxes functional constraint on its protein coding sequence leading to the asymmetric accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations. Thus, our data both affirm Ohno’s prediction while explaining the mechanism by which functional divergence initially occurs following duplication for dispersed gene duplicates.},

        , Malaria remains one of the most severe public health challenges worldwide (). Although several available drugs have been successful in controlling malaria in the past, most of them are rapidly losing efficacy due to acquired drug resistance in the most lethal causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum (). This creates an urgent need for new drugs and treatments, as well as better understanding of the parasite physiology. With this in mind, we built a genome-scale flux-balance model of the P. falciparum metabolism. Given the complex life cycle of Plasmodium, the flux-balanced model is of direct relevance to the ongoing search to identify new therapeutic drug targets. The model can be used to explore diverse metabolic states of the parasite and identify essential metabolic genes in the context of known alternative pathways ()., The reconstructed model, which is based on Plasmodium-specific databases, genomic annotations, and literature reports, includes 366 genes, 1001 reactions, 616 metabolic species, and 4 cellular compartments. We applied flux-balance analysis ({FBA}) () to identify the genes and reactions that are required to produce a set of necessary biomass components. Interestingly, compared with the yeast metabolic network (), a model eukaryote with a similar genome size, the Plasmodium network has a significantly higher proportion of essential genes; we confirmed this result using a comparative analysis of known gene knockouts in the two microbes. This low level of genetic robustness, which is likely due to the parasitic lifestyle, suggests that many metabolic genes of the parasite can be used as effective drug targets. Indeed, based on the in silico analysis we identified 40 essential P. falciparum genes with no or very little sequence identity to their human homologs., We used a recently described small-molecule inhibitor (compound 1\_03; ) to experimentally verify one of the enzymes identified as essential: nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase ({NMNAT}; ). This enzyme, and the corresponding {NAD} synthesis and recycling pathway, have been recently used for anti-microbial development (). However, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used against P. falciparum. The compound 1\_03 was able to completely block host cell escape and reinvasion by arresting parasites in the trophozoite growth stage (). These results demonstrate that the inhibitory compound may be a good starting lead for new anti-malarials., Importantly, the metabolic model of the parasite can be also used to integrate various genomic data, such as gene expression (). To illustrate these possibilities, we applied gene-expression data as constraints for the flux-balance model () in order to predict changes in metabolic exchange fluxes. We found that the model was able to correctly predict the changes in external metabolite concentrations () with about 70\% accuracy (). The availability of a human metabolic network reconstruction () would allow, in the future, to analyze the combined parasite–host network, which would deepen understanding of the P. falciparum metabolic vulnerabilities., Future improvements of the presented P. falciparum metabolic model, for example incorporation of missing activities and yet undiscovered pathways, will lead to a better understanding of parasite physiology. Ultimately, the improved understanding should significantly accelerate the identification and development of desperately needed new drugs against this devastating disease., Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions can serve as important tools for hypothesis generation and high-throughput data integration. Here, we present a metabolic network reconstruction and flux-balance analysis ({FBA}) of Plasmodium falciparum, the primary agent of malaria. The compartmentalized metabolic network accounts for 1001 reactions and 616 metabolites. Enzyme–gene associations were established for 366 genes and 75\% of all enzymatic reactions. Compared with other microbes, the P. falciparum metabolic network contains a relatively high number of essential genes, suggesting little redundancy of the parasite metabolism. The model was able to reproduce phenotypes of experimental gene knockout and drug inhibition assays with up to 90\% accuracy. Moreover, using constraints based on gene-expression data, the model was able to predict the direction of concentration changes for external metabolites with 70\% accuracy. Using {FBA} of the reconstructed network, we identified 40 enzymatic drug targets (i.e. in silico essential genes), with no or very low sequence identity to human proteins. To demonstrate that the model can be used to make clinically relevant predictions, we experimentally tested one of the identified drug targets, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, using a recently discovered small-molecule inhibitor.},

Four species—called long-term retention ({LtR}) species—are known to sequester ingested plastids within specialized cells of the digestive gland. There, the stolen plastids (kleptoplasts) remain photosynthetically active for several months, during which time {LtR} species can survive without additional food uptake. Kleptoplast longevity has long been puzzling, because the slugs do not sequester algal nuclei that could support photosystem maintenance. It is widely assumed that the slugs survive starvation by means of kleptoplast photosynthesis, yet direct evidence to support that view is lacking. We show that two {LtR} plakobranchids, Elysia timida and Plakobranchus ocellatus, incorporate 14CO2 into acid-stable products 60- and 64-fold more rapidly in the light than in the dark, respectively. Despite this light-dependent {CO}2 fixation ability, light is, surprisingly, not essential for the slugs to survive starvation. {LtR} animals survived several months of starvation (i) in complete darkness and (ii) in the light in the presence of the photosynthesis inhibitor monolinuron, all while not losing weight faster than the control animals. Contrary to current views, sacoglossan kleptoplasts seem to be slowly digested food reserves, not a source of solar power.},

Therefore, little selective pressure is expected on the dosage or expression of individual metabolic genes, yet entire pathways should still be constrained. However, a direct estimate of this selective pressure had not been evaluated. Whole-genome duplications ({WGDs}) offer a good opportunity to address this question by analyzing the fates of metabolic genes during the massive gene losses that follow. Here, we take advantage of the successive rounds of {WGD} that occurred in the Paramecium lineage. We show that metabolic genes exhibit different gene retention patterns than nonmetabolic genes. Contrary to what was expected for individual genes, metabolic genes appeared more retained than other genes after the recent {WGD}, which was best explained by selection for gene expression operating on entire pathways. Metabolic genes also tend to be less retained when present at high copy number before {WGD}, contrary to other genes that show a positive correlation between gene retention and preduplication copy number. This is rationalized on the basis of the classical concave relationship relating metabolic fluxes with enzyme expression.},

Hope for a consistent scaling law fades away, as observed exponents significantly correspond with the considered rules only in a minority of cases: (1) exponent r of N∝d¯{rN} {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}bar d{\textasciicircum}r varies around Reineke’s constant −1.605, but is significantly different from r=−2, supposed by Euclidian or fractal scaling, (2) Exponent c of the self-thinning line w¯∝Nc{\textbackslash}bar w {\textbackslash}propto N{\textasciicircum}c roams roughly about the Euclidian scaling constant −3/2, (3) Exponent a of w∝daw {\textbackslash}propto d{\textasciicircum}a tends to follow fractal scaling 8/3. The unique dataset’s evaluation displays that (4) scaling exponents and their oscillation are species-specific, (5) Euclidian scaling of one relation and fractal scaling of another are coupled, depending on species. Ecological implications of the results in respect to self-tolerance (common oak {\textgreater} Norway spruce {\textgreater} Scots pine {\textgreater} common beech) and efficiency of space occupation (common beech {\textgreater} Scots pine {\textgreater} Norway spruce {\textgreater} common oak) are stressed and severe consequences for assessing, regulating and scheduling stand density are discussed.},

The web-tool presented here uses this approach to perform an exhaustive integrative analysis, identification and annotation of potential promoter regions. The combination of methods employed includes searches in different experimental promoter databases to identify promoter regions and their orthologs, use of {TFBS} databases and search tools, and a phylogenetic footprinting strategy, combining multiple alignment of genomic sequences together with motif discovery tools that were tested previously in order to get the best method combination.

Surprisingly, there is little consensus on how to combine selection pressures (i.e., molecules used in the treatment of pests or pathogens) over space and time to delay or prevent this evolutionary process. By reviewing theoretical models and experimental studies, we show that higher levels of heterogeneity of selection are associated with longer-term sustainability of pest or pathogen control. The combination of molecules usually outcompetes other resistance management strategies, such as Responsive alternation, Periodic application, or Mosaic, because it ensures ‘multiple intragenerational killing’. A strategic deployment over space and/or time of several combinations can ensure ‘multiple intergenerational killing’, further delaying the evolution of resistance.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades a large number of algorithms has been developed for regulatory motif finding. Here we show how many of these algorithms, especially those that model binding specificities of regulatory factors with position specific weight matrices ({WMs}), naturally arise within a general Bayesian probabilistic framework. We discuss how {WMs} are constructed from sets of regulatory sites, how sites for a given {WM} can be discovered by scanning of large sequences, how to cluster {WMs}, and more generally how to cluster large sets of sites from different {WMs} into clusters. We discuss how 'regulatory modules', clusters of sites for subsets of {WMs}, can be found in large intergenic sequences, and we discuss different methods for ab initio motif finding, including expectation maximization ({EM}) algorithms, and motif sampling algorithms. Finally, we extensively discuss how module finding methods and ab initio motif finding methods can be extended to take phylogenetic relations between the input sequences into account, i.e. we show how motif finding and phylogenetic footprinting can be integrated in a rigorous probabilistic framework. The article is intended for readers with a solid background in applied mathematics, and preferably with some knowledge of general Bayesian probabilistic methods. The main purpose of the article is to elucidate that all these methods are not a disconnected set of individual algorithmic recipes, but that they are just different facets of a single integrated probabilistic theory.

As protein-coding {DNA} sequences evolve as triplets of nucleotides (codons) and it is known that sequence similarity degrades more rapidly at the {DNA} than at the amino acid level, alignments are generally more accurate when based on amino acids than on their corresponding nucleotides. {TranslatorX} novelties include: (i) use of all documented genetic codes and the possibility of assigning different genetic codes for each sequence; (ii) a battery of different multiple alignment programs; (iii) translation of ambiguous codons when possible; (iv) an innovative criterion to clean nucleotide alignments with {GBlocks} based on protein information; and (v) a rich output, including Jalview-powered graphical visualization of the alignments, codon-based alignments coloured according to the corresponding amino acids, measures of compositional bias and first, second and third codon position specific alignments.

	abstract = {Polyploidy is generally not tolerated in animals, but is widespread in plant genomes and may result in extensive genetic redundancy. The fate of duplicated genes is poorly understood, both functionally and evolutionarily. Soybean (Glycine max L.) has undergone two separate polyploidy events (13 and 59 million years ago) that have resulted in 75\% of its genes being present in multiple copies. It therefore constitutes a good model to study the impact of whole-genome duplication on gene expression. Using {RNA}-seq, we tested the functional fate of a set of approximately 18 000 duplicated genes. Across seven tissues tested, approximately 50\% of paralogs were differentially expressed and thus had undergone expression sub-functionalization. Based on gene ontology and expression data, our analysis also revealed that only a small proportion of the duplicated genes have been neo-functionalized or non-functionalized. In addition, duplicated genes were often found in collinear blocks, and several blocks of duplicated genes were co-regulated, suggesting some type of epigenetic or positional regulation. We also found that transcription factors and ribosomal protein genes were differentially expressed in many tissues, suggesting that the main consequence of polyploidy in soybean may be at the regulatory level.},

	abstract = {Quantitative genetic models of evolution of phenotypic plasticity are used to derive environmental tolerance curves for a population in a changing environment, providing a theoretical foundation for integrating physiological and community ecology with evolutionary genetics of plasticity and norms of reaction. Plasticity is modelled for a labile quantitative character undergoing continuous reversible development and selection in a fluctuating environment. If there is no cost of plasticity, a labile character evolves expected plasticity equalling the slope of the optimal phenotype as a function of the environment. This contrasts with previous theory for plasticity influenced by the environment at a critical stage of early development determining a constant adult phenotype on which selection acts, for which the expected plasticity is reduced by the environmental predictability over the discrete time lag between development and selection. With a cost of plasticity in a labile character, the expected plasticity depends on the cost and on the environmental variance and predictability averaged over the continuous developmental time lag. Environmental tolerance curves derived from this model confirm traditional assumptions in physiological ecology and provide new insights. Tolerance curve width increases with larger environmental variance, but can only evolve within a limited range. The strength of the trade-off between tolerance curve height and width depends on the cost of plasticity. Asymmetric tolerance curves caused by male sterility at high temperature are illustrated. A simple condition is given for a large transient increase in plasticity and tolerance curve width following a sudden change in average environment.},

	abstract = {The mechanosensory lateral line, found only in fishes and amphibians, is an important sense organ associated with aquatic life. Lateral line patterns differ among teleost, the most diverse vertebrate taxa, hypothetically in response to selective pressures from different aquatic habitats. In this article, we conduct evolutionary genomic analyses of 34 genes associated with lateral line system development in teleosts to elucidate the significance of contrasting evolutionary rates and changes in the protein coding sequences. We find that duplicated copies of these genes are preferentially retained in the teleost genomes and that episodic events of positive selection have occurred in 22 of the 30 postduplication branches. In general, teleost genes evolved at a faster rate relative to their tetrapod counterparts, and the mutation rates of 26 of the 34 genes differed among teleosts and tetrapods. We conclude that following whole genome duplication, evolutionary rates and episodic events of positive selection on the lateral line system development genes might have been one of the factors favoring the subsequent adaptive radiation of teleosts into diverse habitats. These results provide the foundation for further detailed explorations into lateral line system genes and the evolution of diverse phenotypes and adaptations.},

	abstract = {We analyze weak fluctuating selection on a quantitative character in an age-structured population not subject to density regulation. We assume that early in the first year of life before selection, during a critical state of development, environments exert a plastic effect on the phenotype, which remains constant throughout the life of an individual. Age-specific selection on the character affects survival and fecundity, which have intermediate optima subject to temporal environmental fluctuations with directional selection in some age classes as special cases. Weighting individuals by their reproductive value, as suggested by Fisher, we show that the expected response per year in the weighted mean character has the same form as for models with no age structure. Environmental stochasticity generates stochastic fluctuations in the weighted mean character following a first-order autoregressive model with a temporally autocorrelated noise term and stationary variance depending on the amount of phenotypic plasticity. The parameters of the process are simple weighted averages of parameters used to describe age-specific survival and fecundity. The “age-specific selective weights” are related to the stable distribution of reproductive values among age classes. This allows partitioning of the change in the weighted mean character into age-specific components.},

We note challenges faced owing to its high content of repetitive elements and {GC} bases, as well as the absence of broad-scale sequence information from closely related species. Analyses of the assembly indicate that two whole-genome duplications likely occurred before the divergence of ancestral lamprey and gnathostome lineages. Moreover, the results help define key evolutionary events within vertebrate lineages, including the origin of myelin-associated proteins and the development of appendages.

	abstract = {Background
Susumu Ohno’s idea that modern vertebrates are degenerate polyploids (concept referred as 2R hypothesis) has been the subject of intense debate for past four decades. It was proposed that intra-genomic synteny regions (paralogons) in human genome are remains of ancient polyploidization events that occurred early in the vertebrate history. The quadruplicated paralogon centered on human {HOX} clusters is taken as evidence that human {HOX}-bearing chromosomes were structured by two rounds of whole genome duplication ({WGD}) events.
Results
Evolutionary history of human {HOX}-bearing chromosomes (chromosomes 2/7/12/17) was evaluated by the phylogenetic analysis of multigene families with triplicated or quadruplicated distribution on these chromosomes. Topology comparison approach categorized the members of 44 families into four distinct co-duplicated groups. Distinct gene families belonging to a particular co-duplicated group, exhibit similar evolutionary history and hence have duplicated simultaneously, whereas genes of two distinct co-duplicated groups do not share their evolutionary history and have not duplicated in concert with each other.
Conclusion
The recovery of co-duplicated groups suggests that “ancient segmental duplications and rearrangements” is the most rational model of evolutionary events that have generated the triplicated and quadruplicated paralogy regions seen on the human {HOX}-bearing chromosomes.},

Analysis of amphioxus {TEs} can help to shed light on the ancestral status of chordate {TEs} and to understand genome evolution in cephalochordates and early vertebrates. The Branchiostoma floridae genome project has revealed that {TE} content constitutes ∼28\% of the amphioxus genome. Amphioxus {TEs} belong to more than 30 superfamilies, which represent a higher diversity than in vertebrates. Amphioxus {TE} families are also highly heterogeneous as generally none of their members are drastically more abundant than others, and none of the {TEs} seems to have suffered any massive expansion. Such diversity and heterogeneity make the amphioxus genome not to be particularly prone to major evolutionary changes mediated by {TEs}, and therefore favoring genomic evolutionary stasis. Comparison of {TE} diversity and content between amphioxus and vertebrates allows us to discuss whether or not a burst of {TEs} happened after the two rounds of whole-genome duplication that occurred during early vertebrate evolution.},

	abstract = {It is well established that sequence divergence has an inhibitory effect on homologous recombination. However, a detailed analysis of this relationship is missing for most higher eukaryotes. We have measured the rate of somatic recombination between direct repeats as a function of the number, type, and position of divergent nucleotides in Arabidopsis. We show that a minor divergence level of 0.16\% (one mutation in otherwise identical 618 bp) has a profound effect, decreasing the recombination rate approximately threefold. A further increase in the divergence level affects the recombination rate to a smaller extent until a “divergence saturation” effect is reached at relatively low levels of divergence (∼0.5\%). The type of mismatched nucleotide does not affect recombination rates. The decrease in the rate of recombination caused by a single mismatch was not affected by the position of the mismatch along the repeat. This suggests that most recombination intermediate tracts contain a mismatch and thus are as long as the full length of the 618-bp repeats. Finally, we could deduce an antirecombination efficiency of ∼66\% for the first mismatch in the repeat. Altogether, this work shows some degree of conservation across kingdoms when compared to previous reports in yeast; it also provides new insight into the effect of sequence divergence on homologous recombination.},

To explore the role of selection in shaping the current order of coding genes and their cis-regulatory elements, a comparative genomic approach was applied to the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its close relatives. S. cerevisiae have experienced a whole-genome duplication followed by an extensive reorganization process of gene order, during which a number of new adjacent gene pairs appeared. We found that the proportion of new adjacent gene pairs in divergent orientation is significantly reduced, suggesting that such new divergent gene pairs may be disfavored most likely because their coregulation may be deleterious. It is also found that such new divergent gene pairs have particularly long intergenic regions. These observations suggest that selection specifically worked against deletions in intergenic regions of new divergent gene pairs, perhaps because they should be physically kept away so that they are not coregulated. It is indicated that gene regulation would be one of the major factors to determine the order of coding genes. gene order, whole genome duplication, budding yeast, gene regulation.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome duplications ({WGDs}), thought to facilitate evolutionary innovations and adaptations, have been uncovered in many phylogenetic lineages. {WGDs} are frequently inferred from duplicate age distributions, where they manifest themselves as peaks against a small-scale duplication background. However, the interpretation of duplicate age distributions is complicated by the use of {KS}, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, as a proxy for the age of paralogs. Two particular concerns are the stochastic nature of synonymous substitutions leading to increasing uncertainty in {KS} with increasing age since duplication and {KS} saturation caused by the inability of evolutionary models to fully correct for the occurrence of multiple substitutions at the same site. {KS} stochasticity is expected to erode the signal of older {WGDs}, whereas {KS} saturation may lead to artificial peaks in the distribution. Here, we investigate the consequences of these effects on {KS}-based age distributions and {WGD} inference by simulating the evolution of duplicated sequences according to predefined real age distributions and re-estimating the corresponding {KS} distributions. We show that, although {KS} estimates can be used for {WGD} inference far beyond the commonly accepted {KS} threshold of 1, {KS} saturation effects can cause artificial peaks at higher ages. Moreover, {KS} stochasticity and saturation may lead to confounded peaks encompassing multiple {WGD} events and/or saturation artifacts. We argue that {KS} effects need to be properly accounted for when inferring {WGDs} from age distributions and that the failure to do so could lead to false inferences.},

To answer this question, we define a statistical measure of motif-motif similarity, and we describe an algorithm, called Tomtom, for searching a database of motifs with a given query motif. Experimental simulations demonstrate the accuracy of Tomtom's E values and its effectiveness in finding similar motifs.

In this chapter, we describe a practical method for reconstructing metabolic networks from {KEGG}. This method makes use of organism-specific pathway data in the {KEGG}/{PATHWAY} database to reconstruct metabolic networks on pathway level, and the pathway hierarchy data in the {KEGG}/{ORTHOLOGY} database to guide the network reconstruction on higher levels. By calling upon the {KEGG} Web services, this method ensures the data used in the reconstruction are correct and up-to-date. The incorporation of a local relational database allows caching of pathway data improves performance and speeds up network reconstruction. Some applications of reconstructed networks on network alignment and network topology analysis are exampled and notes are stated in the end.},

A contemporary take on this subject is to model populations with interactions structured as close as possible to actual social networks. These networks are heterogeneous in the number and type of contact each member has. Our paper demonstrates that the fate of cooperation in such heterogeneous populations critically depends on the rate at which interactions occur and how interactions translate into the fitnesses of the strategies. We also develop theory that allows for an evolutionary analysis in heterogeneous populations. This includes deriving appropriate criteria for evolutionary advantage.},

Here we show that the D. radiodurans genome assumes an unusual toroidal morphology that may contribute to its radioresistance.

	abstract = {Recent advances have highlighted the ubiquity of whole-genome duplication (polyploidy) in angiosperms, although subsequent genome size change and diploidization (returning to a diploid-like condition) are poorly understood. An excellent system to assess these processes is provided by Nicotiana section Repandae, which arose via allopolyploidy (approximately 5 million years ago) involving relatives of Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana obtusifolia. Subsequent speciation in Repandae has resulted in allotetraploids with divergent genome sizes, including Nicotiana repanda and Nicotiana nudicaulis studied here, which have an estimated 23.6\% genome expansion and 19.2\% genome contraction from the early polyploid, respectively. Graph-based clustering of next-generation sequence data enabled assessment of the global genome composition of these allotetraploids and their diploid progenitors. Unexpectedly, in both allotetraploids, over 85\% of sequence clusters (repetitive {DNA} families) had a lower abundance than predicted from their diploid relatives; a trend seen particularly in low-copy repeats. The loss of high-copy sequences predominantly accounts for the genome downsizing in N. nudicaulis. In contrast, N. repanda shows expansion of clusters already inherited in high copy number (mostly chromovirus-like Ty3/Gypsy retroelements and some low-complexity sequences), leading to much of the genome upsizing predicted. We suggest that the differential dynamics of low- and high-copy sequences reveal two genomic processes that occur subsequent to allopolyploidy. The loss of low-copy sequences, common to both allopolyploids, may reflect genome diploidization, a process that also involves loss of duplicate copies of genes and upstream regulators. In contrast, genome size divergence between allopolyploids is manifested through differential accumulation and/or deletion of high-copy-number sequences.},

	abstract = {We used a phylogenetic footprinting approach, adapted to high levels of divergence, to estimate the level of constraint in intergenic regions of the extremely gene dense Ostreococcus algae genomes (Chlorophyta, Prasinophyceae). We first benchmarked our method against the Saccharomyces sensu stricto genome data and found that the proportion of conserved non-coding sites was consistent with those obtained with methods using calibration by the neutral substitution rate. We then applied our method to the complete genomes of Ostreococcus tauri and O. lucimarinus, which are the most divergent species from the same genus sequenced so far. We found that 77\% of intergenic regions in Ostreococcus still contain some phylogenetic footprints, as compared to 88\% for Saccharomyces, corresponding to an average rate of constraint on intergenic region of 17\% and 30\%, respectively. A comparison with some known functional cis-regulatory elements enabled us to investigate whether some transcriptional regulatory pathways were conserved throughout the green lineage. Strikingly, the size of the phylogenetic footprints depends on gene orientation of neighboring genes, and appears to be genus-specific. In Ostreococcus, 5′ intergenic regions contain four times more conserved sites than 3′ intergenic regions, whereas in yeast a higher frequency of constrained sites in intergenic regions between genes on the same {DNA} strand suggests a higher frequency of bidirectional regulatory elements. The phylogenetic footprinting approach can be used despite high levels of divergence in the ultrasmall Ostreococcus algae, to decipher structure of constrained regulatory motifs, and identify putative regulatory pathways conserved within the green lineage.},

To determine why, and to address other fundamental questions about eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis, we sequenced the nuclear genomes of the cryptophyte Guillardia theta and the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans. Both genomes have {\textgreater}21,000 protein genes and are intron rich, and B. natans exhibits unprecedented alternative splicing for a single-celled organism. Phylogenomic analyses and subcellular targeting predictions reveal extensive genetic and biochemical mosaicism, with both host- and endosymbiont-derived genes servicing the mitochondrion, the host cell cytosol, the plastid and the remnant endosymbiont cytosol of both algae. Mitochondrion-to-nucleus gene transfer still occurs in both organisms but plastid-to-nucleus and nucleomorph-to-nucleus transfers do not, which explains why a small residue of essential genes remains locked in each nucleomorph.},

Per-locus analyses of gene duplication rates in the pre-genomic era revealed that gene duplication rates are much higher than the per nucleotide substitution rate. Analyses of gene duplication and deletion rates in mutation accumulation lines of model organisms have revealed that these high rates of copy-number mutations occur at a genome-wide scale. Furthermore, comparisons of the spontaneous duplication and deletion rates to copy-number polymorphism data and bioinformatic-based estimates of duplication rates from sequenced genomes suggest that the vast majority of gene duplications are detrimental and removed by natural selection. The rate at which new gene copies appear in populations greatly influences their evolutionary dynamics and standing gene copy-number variation in populations. The opportunity for mutations that result in the maintenance of duplicate copies, either through neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization, also depends on the equilibrium frequency of additional gene copies in the population, and hence on the spontaneous gene duplication (and loss) rate. The duplication rate may therefore have profound effects on the role of adaptation in the evolution of duplicated genes as well as important consequences for the evolutionary potential of organisms. We further discuss the broad ramifications of this standing gene copy-number variation on fitness and adaptive potential from a population-genetic and genome-wide perspective.},

There is an exquisite control system where each stage of the process is controlled both by seemingly unregulated proteins as well as through feedbacks mediated by {RNA} and protein products. Here we review the biological facts and mathematical models for each stage of the protein production process. We conclude that advances in experimental techniques leading to a detailed description of the process have not been matched by mathematical models that represent the details of the process and facilitate analysis.

The method is based on an analysis of the maximum likelihoods for the three fully resolved tree topologies that can be computed for four sequences. The three likelihoods are represented as one point inside an equilateral triangle. The triangle is partitioned in different regions. One region represents star-like evolution, three regions represent a well-resolved phylogeny, and three regions reflect the situation where it is difficult to distinguish between two of the three trees. The location of the likelihoods in the triangle defines the mode of sequence evolution. If n sequences are analyzed, then the likelihoods for each subset of four sequences are mapped onto the triangle. The resulting distribution of points shows whether the data are suitable for a phylogenetic reconstruction or not.},

For example, human individuals belonging to the same ethnic groups interact more than those from different ethnic groups. Cellular functions are also organized in a highly modular manner, where each module is a discrete object composed of a group of tightly linked components and performs a relatively independent task. It is interesting to ask whether this modularity in cellular function arises from modularity in molecular interaction networks such as the transcriptional regulatory network and protein–protein interaction ({PPI}) network. We analyze the yeast {PPI} network and show that it is indeed significantly more modular than randomly rewired networks. However, we find little evidence that the structural modules correspond to functional units. We also fail to observe any evolutionary conservation among yeast, fly, and nematode {PPI} modules. We then show by computer simulation that modular structures can arise during network growth via a simple model of gene duplication, without natural selection for modularity. Thus, it appears that the structural modules in the {PPI} network may have originated as an evolutionary byproduct without much biological significance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Multiple rounds of whole genome duplication have repeatedly marked the evolution of vertebrates, and correlate strongly with morphological innovation. However, less is known about the behavioral, physiological and ecological consequences of genome duplication, and whether these events coincide with major transitions in vertebrate complexity. The complex behavior of anadromy - where adult fishes migrate up rivers from the sea to their natal site to spawn - is well known in salmonid fishes. Some hypotheses suggest that migratory behavior evolved as a consequence of an ancestral genome duplication event, which permitted salinity tolerance and osmoregulatory plasticity. Here we test whether anadromy evolved multiple times within salmonids, and whether genome duplication coincided with the evolution of anadromy. We present a method that uses ancestral character simulation data to plot the frequency of character transitions over a time calibrated phylogenetic tree to provide estimates of the absolute timing of character state transitions. Furthermore, we incorporate extinct and extant taxa to improve on previous estimates of divergence times. We present the first phylogenetic evidence indicating that anadromy evolved at least twice from freshwater salmonid ancestors. Results suggest that genome duplication did not coincide in time with changes in migratory behavior, but preceded a transition to anadromy by 55-50million years. Our study represents the first attempt to estimate the absolute timing of a complex behavioral trait in relation to a genome duplication event.},

Tardigrades have already been exposed to space stressors on Low Earth Orbit several times. The relevance of ground-based and space studies on tardigrades rests on the presumption that results could suggest strategies to protect organisms, also humans, when exposed to the space and lunar environments.},

Both of these factors are well represented by observational approaches to ecology, which are re-emerging after a long period of deference to manipulative experimental approaches. These approaches examine ecological patterns and processes through data gathered in situations where nature has not been purposefully manipulated. The use of unmanipulated observational data reflects on the work of early naturalists, but is greatly enhanced by technological advances in remote sensing, microscopy, genetics, animal-borne sensors, and computing. Once dismissed as merely "exploratory", strictly observational approaches to ecology have demonstrated capability in testing hypotheses by correlating variables, comparing observed patterns to output from existing models, exploiting natural experiments, and simulating experiments within large datasets. These approaches can be used in a stand-alone fashion, but are strengthened when reconciled with experimental manipulations to isolate fine-scale ecological mechanisms.},

	abstract = {C4 plants evolved from C3 plants through a series of complex evolutionary steps. On the basis of the evolution of key C4 enzyme genes, the evolution of C4 photosynthesis has been considered a story of gene/genome duplications and subsequent modifications of gene function. If whole-genome duplication has contributed to the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, other genes should have been duplicated together with these C4 genes. However, which genes were co-duplicated with C4 genes and whether they have also played a role in C4 evolution are largely unknown. In this study, we developed a simple method to characterize the historical profile of the paralogs of a gene by tracing back to the most recent common ancestor ({MRCA}) of the gene and its paralog(s) and then counting the number of paralogs at each {MRCA}. We clustered the genes into clusters with similar duplication profiles and inferred their functional enrichments. Applying our method to maize, a familiar C4 plant, we identified many genes that show similar duplication profiles with those of the key C4 enzyme genes and found that the functional preferences of the C4 gene clusters are not only similar to those identified by an experimental approach in a recent study but also highly consistent with the functions required for the C4 photosynthesis evolutionary model proposed by S.F. Sage. Some of these genes might have co-evolved with the key C4 enzyme genes to increase the strength of C4 photosynthesis. Moreover, our results suggested that most key C4 enzyme genes had different origins and have undergone a long evolutionary process before the emergence of C4 grasses (Andropogoneae), consistent with the conclusion proposed by previous authors.},

Such modifications may be induced by small {RNAs}, which affect key cellular processes, including gene expression, chromatin structure, cytosine methylation and transposable element ({TE}) activity. To date, the role of small {RNAs} in the context of wide hybridization and polyploidization has received little attention. In this work, we performed high-throughput sequencing of small {RNAs} of parental, intergeneric hybrid, and allopolyploid plants that mimic the genomic changes occurring during bread wheat speciation. We found that the percentage of small {RNAs} corresponding to {miRNAs} increased with ploidy level, while the percentage of {siRNAs} corresponding to {TEs} decreased. The abundance of most {miRNA} species was similar to midparent values in the hybrid, with some deviations, as seen in overrepresentation of {miR}168, in the allopolyploid. In contrast, the number of {siRNAs} corresponding to {TEs} strongly decreased upon allopolyploidization, but not upon hybridization. The reduction in corresponding {siRNAs}, together with decreased {CpG} methylation, as shown here for the Veju element, represent hallmarks of {TE} activation. {TE}-{siRNA} downregulation in the allopolyploid may contribute to genome destabilization at the initial stages of speciation. This phenomenon is reminiscent of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila.},

	abstract = {The evolution of genes and genomes after polyploidization has been the subject of extensive studies in evolutionary biology and plant sciences. While a significant number of duplicated genes are rapidly removed during a process called fractionation, which operates after the whole-genome duplication ({WGD}), another considerable number of genes are retained preferentially, leading to the phenomenon of biased gene retention. However, the evolutionary mechanisms underlying gene retention after {WGD} remain largely unknown. Through genome-wide analyses of sequence and functional data, we comprehensively investigated the relationships between gene features and the retention probability of duplicated genes after {WGDs} in six plant genomes, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), soybean (Glycine max), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and maize (Zea mays). The results showed that multiple gene features were correlated with the probability of gene retention. Using a logistic regression model based on principal component analysis, we resolved evolutionary rate, structural complexity, and {GC}3 content as the three major contributors to gene retention. Cluster analysis of these features further classified retained genes into three distinct groups in terms of gene features and evolutionary behaviors. Type I genes are more prone to be selected by dosage balance; type {II} genes are possibly subject to subfunctionalization; and type {III} genes may serve as potential targets for neofunctionalization. This study highlights that gene features are able to act jointly as primary forces when determining the retention and evolution of {WGD}-derived duplicated genes in flowering plants. These findings thus may help to provide a resolution to the debate on different evolutionary models of gene fates after {WGDs}.},

Because genome-wide duplication events duplicate whole molecular networks it is of interest to investigate how these networks evolve subsequent to such events. Although genome duplications are generally followed by massive gene loss, at least part of the network is usually retained in duplicate and can rewire to execute novel functions. Alternatively, the network can remain largely redundant and as such confer robustness against mutations. The increasing availability of high-throughput data makes it possible to study evolution following whole genome duplication events at the network level.

Here we analyzed the molecular features of the {ncRNA} genes, introns, and intergenic sequences of this genome. We mainly used computational programs and comparative genomics possible because the P. tetraurelia genome had formed throughout whole-genome duplications ({WGDs}). We characterized 417 5S {rRNA}, {snRNA}, {snoRNA}, {SRP} {RNA}, and {tRNA} putative genes, 415 of which map within intergenic sequences, and two, within introns. The evolution of these {ncRNA} genes appears to have mainly involved purifying selection and gene deletion. We then compared the introns that interrupt the protein-coding gene duplicates arisen from the recent {WGD} and identified a population of a few thousands of introns having evolved under most stringent constraints ({\textgreater}95\% of identity). We also showed that low nucleotide substitution levels characterize the 50 and 80–115 base pairs flanking, respectively, the stop and start codons of the protein-coding genes. Lower substitution levels mark the base pairs flanking the highly transcribed genes, or the start codons of the genes of the sets with a high number of {WGD}-related sequences. Finally, adjacent to protein-coding genes, we characterized 32 {DNA} motifs able to encode stable and evolutionary conserved {RNA} secondary structures and defining putative expression controlling elements. Fourteen {DNA} motifs with similar properties map distant from protein-coding genes and may encode regulatory {ncRNAs}.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryThe} role of duplicated genes in originating new functions is an important question in evolution. Almost all species have duplicated genes that carry out similar but not identical functions. Similar proteins that perform different functions can also be generated when one gene generates multiple {mRNAs} by alternative splicing that are translated into multiple similar proteins. This alternative splicing is prevalent in animal cells, but much rarer in fungi. Here we show that most fungi use alternative splicing to make a Ski7 protein and a Hbs1 protein from the same gene. Two fungi, budding yeast and fission yeast, have been much better characterized than other fungi, and co-incidentally they both have duplicated this alternatively spliced gene, resulting in two similar genes that are no longer alternatively spliced. Finally, we describe another example where two duplicate genes replace one alternatively spliced gene, suggesting that this is a common mechanism to divide functions among duplicate genes.},

	abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation ({DDC}) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the {DDC} model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates. For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation.Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene.Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely.Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.Cooke et al. 1997 (p. 362)},

	abstract = {A central problem in the bioinformatics of gene regulation is to find the binding sites for regulatory proteins. One of the most promising approaches toward identifying these short and fuzzy sequence patterns is the comparative analysis of orthologous intergenic regions of related species. This analysis is complicated by various factors. First, one needs to take the phylogenetic relationship between the species into account in order to distinguish conservation that is due to the occurrence of functional sites from spurious conservation that is due to evolutionary proximity. Second, one has to deal with the complexities of multiple alignments of orthologous intergenic regions, and one has to consider the possibility that functional sites may occur outside of conserved segments. Here we present a new motif sampling algorithm, {PhyloGibbs}, that runs on arbitrary collections of multiple local sequence alignments of orthologous sequences. The algorithm searches over all ways in which an arbitrary number of binding sites for an arbitrary number of transcription factors ({TFs}) can be assigned to the multiple sequence alignments. These binding site configurations are scored by a Bayesian probabilistic model that treats aligned sequences by a model for the evolution of binding sites and “background” intergenic {DNA}. This model takes the phylogenetic relationship between the species in the alignment explicitly into account. The algorithm uses simulated annealing and Monte Carlo Markov-chain sampling to rigorously assign posterior probabilities to all the binding sites that it reports. In tests on synthetic data and real data from five Saccharomyces species our algorithm performs significantly better than four other motif-finding algorithms, including algorithms that also take phylogeny into account. Our results also show that, in contrast to the other algorithms, {PhyloGibbs} can make realistic estimates of the reliability of its predictions. Our tests suggest that, running on the five-species multiple alignment of a single gene's upstream region, {PhyloGibbs} on average recovers over 50\% of all binding sites in S. cerevisiae at a specificity of about 50\%, and 33\% of all binding sites at a specificity of about 85\%. We also tested {PhyloGibbs} on collections of multiple alignments of intergenic regions that were recently annotated, based on {ChIP}-on-chip data, to contain binding sites for the same {TF}. We compared {PhyloGibbs}'s results with the previous analysis of these data using six other motif-finding algorithms. For 16 of 21 {TFs} for which all other motif-finding methods failed to find a significant motif, {PhyloGibbs} did recover a motif that matches the literature consensus. In 11 cases where there was disagreement in the results we compiled lists of known target genes from the literature, and found that running {PhyloGibbs} on their regulatory regions yielded a binding motif matching the literature consensus in all but one of the cases. Interestingly, these literature gene lists had little overlap with the targets annotated based on the {ChIP}-on-chip data. The {PhyloGibbs} code can be downloaded from http://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/{\textasciitilde}nimwegen/cgi-bin/phylogibbs.cgi or http://www.imsc.res.in/{\textasciitilde}rsidd/phylogibbs.

	abstract = {Subsequent to the two rounds of whole-genome duplication that occurred in the common ancestor of vertebrates, a third genome duplication occurred in the stem lineage of teleost fishes. This teleost-specific genome duplication ({TGD}) is thought to have provided genetic raw materials for the physiological, morphological, and behavioral diversification of this highly speciose group. The extreme physiological versatility of teleost fish is manifest in their diversity of blood–gas transport traits, which reflects the myriad solutions that have evolved to maintain tissue O2 delivery in the face of changing metabolic demands and environmental O2 availability during different ontogenetic stages. During the course of development, regulatory changes in blood–O2 transport are mediated by the expression of multiple, functionally distinct hemoglobin (Hb) isoforms that meet the particular O2-transport challenges encountered by the developing embryo or fetus (in viviparous or oviparous species) and in free-swimming larvae and adults. The main objective of the present study was to assess the relative contributions of whole-genome duplication, large-scale segmental duplication, and small-scale gene duplication in producing the extraordinary functional diversity of teleost Hbs. To accomplish this, we integrated phylogenetic reconstructions with analyses of conserved synteny to characterize the genomic organization and evolutionary history of the globin gene clusters of teleosts. These results were then integrated with available experimental data on functional properties and developmental patterns of stage-specific gene expression. Our results indicate that multiple α- and β-globin genes were present in the common ancestor of gars (order Lepisoteiformes) and teleosts. The comparative genomic analysis revealed that teleosts possess a dual set of {TGD}-derived globin gene clusters, each of which has undergone lineage-specific changes in gene content via repeated duplication and deletion events. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that paralogous genes convergently evolved similar functional properties in different teleost lineages. Consistent with other recent studies of globin gene family evolution in vertebrates, our results revealed evidence for repeated evolutionary transitions in the developmental regulation of Hb synthesis.},

	abstract = {Gene duplication is an important mechanism for acquiring new genes and creating genetic novelty in organisms. Many new gene functions have evolved through gene duplication and it has contributed tremendously to the evolution of developmental programmes in various organisms. Gene duplication can result from unequal crossing over, retroposition or chromosomal (or genome) duplication. Understanding the mechanisms that generate duplicate gene copies and the subsequent dynamics among gene duplicates is vital because these investigations shed light on localized and genomewide aspects of evolutionary forces shaping intra-specific and inter-specific genome contents, evolutionary relationships, and interactions. Based on whole-genome analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana, there is compelling evidence that angiosperms underwent two whole-genome duplication events early during their evolutionary history. Recent studies have shown that these events were crucial for creation of many important developmental and regulatory genes found in extant angiosperm genomes. Recent studies also provide strong indications that even yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae), with its compact genome, is in fact an ancient tetraploid. Gene duplication can provide new genetic material for mutation, drift and selection to act upon, the result of which is specialized or new gene functions. Without gene duplication the plasticity of a genome or species in adapting to changing environments would be severely limited. Whether a duplicate is retained depends upon its function, its mode of duplication, (i.e. whether it was duplicated during a whole-genome duplication event), the species in which it occurs, and its expression rate. The exaptation of preexisting secondary functions is an important feature in gene evolution, just as it is in morphological evolution.},

Dmrt1 is the master regulator of sex determination in very distant metazoans, while Dmrt2 and Dmrt4 are of crucial importance in vertebrate somitogenesis and neurogenesis, respectively. To elucidate the evolutionary divergence of the fish dmrt genes, we examined the expression patterns and the chromosomal synteny of the five dmrt genes identified in the Atlantic cod genome. Quantitative {PCR} analyses of cod dmrt1, dmrt2a, dmrt3, dmrt4 and dmrt5 revealed distinct expression patterns in the embryo and larvae, and indicated conserved extragonadal functions during early development. Several dmrt genes seem to be involved in the sexual differentiation of gonads and brain, but the sex-dimorphic expression patterns differed substantially between teleosts, suggesting functional switch between Dmrt members. The dmrt2a–dmrt3–dmrt1 cluster was found to be located in a conserved syntenic region, and the flanking genes have become duplicated in teleosts and are closely linked in a paralogous region lacking the dmrt cluster. Similarly, the region containing the fish-specific dmrt2b gene was found to have a paralogous region without a dmrt2b duplicate in a separate linkage group in the teleost genomes. We propose that the teleost segments paralogous to the dmrt2a- and dmrt2b regions, respectively, were formed through the fish-specific whole genome duplication (3R), while dmrt2a and dmrt2b originated from the second round (2R) of whole genome duplication of the ancestral dmrt2. The dmrt2b paralog seems to have been lost in Atlantic cod as in tetrapods and may be a pseudogene in pufferfish, while dmrt2a and dmrt2b have acquired different functions in zebrafish. Contrasting with the retained duplicates of dmrt flanking genes, the massive losses of dmrt duplicates in the vertebrate tetraploidizations suggest that their functions are exquisitely sensitive to gene dosage.},

In this study, we identified the auxin response factor ({ARF}) gene family, which is one of the key regulators of auxin-mediated plant growth and development in the B. rapa genome. A total of 31 {ARF} genes were identified in the genome. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses suggest that {ARF} genes fell into four major classes and were amplified in the B. rapa genome as a result of a recent whole genome triplication after speciation from Arabidopsis thaliana. Despite its recent hexaploid ancestry, B. rapa includes a relatively small number of {ARF} genes compared with the 23 members in A. thaliana, presumably due to a paralog reduction related to repetitive sequence insertion into promoter and non-coding transcribed region of the genes. Comparative genomic and {mRNA} sequencing analyses demonstrated that 27 of the 31 {BrARF} genes were transcriptionally active, and their expression was affected by either auxin treatment or floral development stage, although 4 genes were inactive, suggesting that the generation and pseudogenization of {ARF} members are likely to be an ongoing process. This study will provide a fundamental basis for the modification and evolution of the gene family after a polyploidy event, as well as a functional study of {ARF} genes in a polyploidy crop species.},

	abstract = {Metabolic engineering emerged 20 years ago as the discipline occupied with the directed modification of metabolic pathways for the microbial synthesis of various products. As such, it deals with the engineering (design, construction, and optimization) of native as well as non-natural routes of product synthesis, aided in this task by the availability of synthetic {DNA}, the core enabling technology of synthetic biology. The two fields, however, only partially overlap in their interest in pathway engineering. While fabrication of biobricks, synthetic cells, genetic circuits, and nonlinear cell dynamics, along with pathway engineering, have occupied researchers in the field of synthetic biology, the sum total of these areas does not constitute a coherent definition of synthetic biology with a distinct intellectual foundation and well-defined areas of application. This paper reviews the origins of the two fields and advances two distinct paradigms for each of them: that of unit operations for metabolic engineering and electronic circuits for synthetic biology. In this context, metabolic engineering is about engineering cell factories for the biological manufacturing of chemical and pharmaceutical products, whereas the main focus of synthetic biology is fundamental biological research facilitated by the use of synthetic {DNA} and genetic circuits.},

We suggest that the fields of evo-devo, functional morphology, and evolutionary ecology should be united under a common framework based on three predictions. The first is that morphological disparity should scale positively with functional complexity among different radiations. The second is that functional complexity should correlate negatively with the predictability of evolutionary divergence within lineages, and the third is that functional complexity should define the genetic architecture of adaptive radiations.

The analysis of gene evolution is a powerful approach to recognize the genetic features that contribute to the fitness of organisms. It was shown previously that selective constraints on protein sequences increase with expression level. This observation was surprising because there is a priori no reason why lowly expressed genes should be less important than highly expressed genes for the proper function of an organism. Here we show that selective pressure on the evolution of gene dosage, which is another important aspect of gene evolution, is also directly dependent on gene expression level. To explain these observations, we propose a model based on the fact that gene expression is a costly process (notably protein synthesis), so that there is an optimal expression level for each gene corresponding to a trade-off between the benefit and the cost of its expression. This model predicts that selective pressure on gene expression level or on the encoded protein should on average be stronger in highly expressed genes, providing a simple and common explanation for the general relationship observed between gene expression and the different facets of gene evolution.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}
Paramecium tetraurelia is a widely distributed, free-living unicellular organism that feeds on bacteria and can easily be cultured in the laboratory. Its position within the phylum Ciliophora, remote from the most commonly used models, offers an interesting perspective on the basic cellular and molecular processes of eukaryotic life. Its large size and complex cellular organization facilitate morphogenetic studies of conserved structures, such as cilia and basal bodies, as well as electrophysiological studies of swimming behavior. Like all ciliates, P. tetraurelia contains two distinct types of nuclei, the germline micronucleus ({MIC}) and the somatic macronucleus ({MAC}), which differentiate from copies of the zygotic nucleus after fertilization. The sexual cycle can be managed by controlling food uptake, allowing the study of a developmentally regulated differentiation program in synchronous cultures. Spectacular genome rearrangements occur during the development of the somatic macronucleus. Their epigenetic control by {RNA}-mediated homology-dependent mechanisms, which might underlie long-known cases of non-Mendelian inheritance, provides evolutionary insight into the diversity of small {RNA} pathways involved in genome regulation. Being endowed with two alternative modes of sexual reproduction (conjugation and autogamy), P. tetraurelia is ideally suited for genetic analyses, and the recent sequencing of its macronuclear genome revealed one of the largest numbers of genes in any eukaryote. Together with the development of new molecular techniques, including complementation cloning and an easily implemented technique for reverse genetics based on {RNA} interference ({RNAi}), these features make P. tetraurelia a very attractive unicellular model.},

Such readily accessible data have encouraged the proliferation of adaptive arguments for the evolution of gene and genomic features, often with little or no attention being given to simpler and more powerful alternative explanations. By integrating the central observations from molecular biology and population genetics relevant to comparative genomics, Lynch shows why the details matter. Presented in a nontechnical fashion, at both the population-genetic and molecular-genetic levels, this book offers a unifying explanatory framework for how the peculiar architectural diversity of eukaryotic genomes and genes came to arise. Under Lynch's hypothesis, the genome-wide repatterning of eukaryotic gene structure, which resulted primarily from nonadaptive processes, provided an entirely novel resource from which natural selection could secondarily build new forms of organismal complexity.\}},

	abstract = {Clonal reproduction is associated with the incidence of polyploidy in flowering plants. This pattern may arise through selection for increased clonality in polyploids compared to diploids to reduce mixed-ploidy mating. Here, we test whether clonal reproduction is greater in tetraploid than diploid populations of the mixed-ploidy plant, Chamerion angustifolium, through an analysis of the size and spatial distribution of clones in natural populations using {AFLP} genotyping and a comparison of root bud production in a greenhouse study. Natural tetraploid populations (N = 5) had significantly more {AFLP} genotypes (x¯ = 10.8) than diploid populations (x¯ = 6.0). Tetraploid populations tended to have fewer ramets per genotype and fewer genotypes with {\textgreater}1 ramet. In a spatial autocorrelation analysis, ramets within genotypes were more spatially aggregated in diploid populations than in tetraploid populations. In the greenhouse, tetraploids allocated 90.4\% more dry mass to root buds than diploids, but tetraploids produced no more root buds and 44\% fewer root buds per unit root mass than diploids. Our results indicate that clonal reproduction is significant in most populations, but tetraploid populations are not more clonal than diploids, nor are their clones more spatially aggregated. As a result, tetraploids may be less sheltered from mixed-ploidy mating and diploids more exposed to inbreeding, the balance of which could influence the establishment of tetraploids in diploid populations.},

Circadian rhythms contribute to evolutionary fitness, suggesting that circadian rhythmicity may also contribute to agricultural productivity. Therefore, we extend our study of the plant circadian clock to Brassica rapa, an agricultural crop. Since its separation from Arabidopsis, B. rapa has undergone whole genome triplication and subsequent diploidization that has involved considerable gene loss. We find that circadian clock genes are preferentially retained relative to comparison groups of their neighboring genes, a set of randomly chosen genes, and a set of housekeeping genes broadly conserved in eukaryotes. The preferential retention of clock genes is consistent with the gene dosage hypothesis, which predicts preferential retention of highly networked or dose-sensitive genes. Two gene families encoding transcription factors that play important roles in the plant core oscillator—the {PSEUDO}-{RESPONSE} {REGULATORS}, including {TIMING} {OF} {CAB} {EXPRESSION}1, and the {REVEILLE} family, including {CIRCADIAN} {CLOCK} {ASSOCIATED}1 and {LATE} {ELONGATED} {HYPOCOTYL}—exhibit preferential retention consistent with the gene dosage hypothesis, but a third gene family, including {ZEITLUPE}, that encodes F-Box proteins that regulate posttranslational protein stability offers an exception.},

Here, we present the first full Hox gene sequences for any member of the Acipenseriformes, the American paddlefish, and confirm that an independent {WGD} occurred in the paddlefish lineage, approximately 42 Ma based on sequences spanning the entire {HoxA} cluster and eight genes on the {HoxD} gene cluster. These clusters comprise different {HOX} loci and maintain conserved synteny relative to bichir, zebrafish, stickleback, and pufferfish, as well as human, mouse, and chick. We also provide a gene genealogy for the duplicated fzd8 gene in paddlefish and present evidence for the first Hox14 gene in any ray-finned fish. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the American paddlefish has an independently duplicated genome. Substitution patterns of the “alpha” paralogs on both the {HoxA} and {HoxD} gene clusters suggest transcriptional inactivation consistent with functional diploidization. Further, there are similarities in the pattern of sequence divergence among duplicated Hox genes in paddlefish and teleost lineages, even though they occurred independently approximately 200 Myr apart. We highlight implications on comparative analyses in the study of the “fin-limb transition” as well as gene and genome duplication in bony fishes, which includes all ray-finned fishes as well as the lobe-finned fishes and tetrapod vertebrates.},

	abstract = {When comparing the known picture of polyploidy in animals and in plants, it is possible to recognize some similarities, namely: (i) multiple and recurrent origins in several well-established taxonomic groups; (ii) a strong and regular association with hybridization events; (iii) the production of genotypic diversity; (iv) a rapid genomic reshuffling; (v) a very active role of transposable elements in allopolyploids; (vi) a comparatively privileged occurrence in harsher environments when compared with their diploid relatives, and (vii) gene silencing and divergence of duplicated genes without disruption of duplicated loci. Research on polyploidy was highly biased towards plants during the last century because polyploidy in animals was for long time considered rare, occasional and irrelevant from an evolutionary perspective. However, as empirically observed in plants, genome rediploidization starts in polyploid organisms immediately after the polyploid shock. Given the speed and dynamicity of this process, evidence of genome multiplication is completely erased over time, and hence, only the most recent events are likely to be acknowledged. Although varying in expression between and within taxonomic groups, polyploidy and hybridization are ubiquitous in animals and may be recurrent, fostering evolution. Since evolutionary allopolyploid genomes behave as biologically diploid, zoologists have to challenge the old paradigm of an irrelevant evolutionary role in animals using current genomic and cytogenomic tools. These methods are most likely to reveal the role of polyploid mechanisms in producing evolutionary novelties. Nonsexual complexes are the perfect models to bridge the gap between empirical and theoretical research, while the evolutionary process is in action. Such animal complexes represent a transient stage that, in general, moves towards a polyploid stage, where bisexuality might be recovered, ultimately giving rise to a new gonochoric species. These pathways are herein illustrated by the Iberian allopolyploid Squalius alburnoides. Some general aspects on this fish's complex are updated and reviewed, namely the reproductive modes of the distinct genomotypes, since variable ploidies and genomic combinations occur in natural populations. Most recent data on the mechanisms of gene expression regulation and the importance of the genomic context in driving allelic expression are also included. It was first demonstrated that a regulatory mechanism involving dosage compensation by gene-copy silencing exists in allotriploid females and that allelic expression patterns differed either between genomically equivalent individuals or within the same individual (between tissues and genes). Thus, instead of a whole haplome inactivation, a biased silencing towards repression of a specific allele was observed as well as a reduction of the transcript levels to the diploid state.

	abstract = {Comparative genome biology has unveiled the polyploid origin of all angiosperms and the role of recurrent polyploidization in the amplification of gene families and the structuring of genomes. Which species share certain ancient polyploidy events, and which do not, is ill defined because of the limited number of sequenced genomes and transcriptomes and their uneven phylogenetic distribution. Previously, it has been suggested that most, but probably not all, of the eudicots have shared an ancient hexaploidy event, referred to as the gamma triplication. In this study, detailed phylogenies of subfamilies of {MADS}-box genes suggest that the gamma triplication has occurred before the divergence of Gunnerales but after the divergence of Buxales and Trochodendrales. Large-scale phylogenetic and {KS}-based approaches on the inflorescence transcriptomes of Gunnera manicata (Gunnerales) and Pachysandra terminalis (Buxales) provide further support for this placement, enabling us to position the gamma triplication in the stem lineage of the core eudicots. This triplication likely initiated the functional diversification of key regulators of reproductive development in the core eudicots, comprising 75\% of flowering plants. Although it is possible that the gamma event triggered early core eudicot diversification, our dating estimates suggest that the event occurred early in the stem lineage, well before the rapid speciation of the earliest core eudicot lineages. The evolutionary significance of this paleopolyploidy event may thus rather lie in establishing a species lineage that was resilient to extinction, but with the genomic potential for later diversification. We consider that the traits generated from this potential characterize extant core eudicots both chemically and morphologically.},

Conversely, synthetic biology has the potential to enrich evolutionary biology by explaining why some adaptive space is empty, on Earth or elsewhere. Synthetic biology, the design and construction of artificial biological systems, substitutes bio-engineering for evolution, which is seen as an obstacle. But because evolution has produced the complexity and diversity of life, it provides a proven toolkit of genetic materials and principles available to synthetic biology. Evolution operates on the population level, with the populations composed of unique individuals that are historical entities. The source of genetic novelty includes mutation, gene regulation, sex, symbiosis, and interspecies gene transfer. At a phenotypic level, variation derives from regulatory control, replication and diversification of components, compartmentalization, sexual selection and speciation, among others. Variation is limited by physical constraints such as diffusion, and chemical constraints such as reaction rates and membrane fluidity. While some of these tools of evolution are currently in use in synthetic biology, all ought to be examined for utility. A hybrid approach of synthetic biology coupled with fine-tuning through evolution is suggested.},

Here, we examined the evolution and function of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mitochondrial {GrpE} (Mge) proteins. {GrpE} acts as a nucleotide-exchange factor in the Hsp70/{DnaK} chaperone machinery. Genomic data show that {AtMge}1 and {AtMge}2 arose from a recent whole-genome duplication event. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that duplication and preservation of Mges occurred independently in many plant species, which suggests a common tendency in the evolution of the genes. Intron retention contributed to the divergence of the protein structure of Mge paralogs in higher plants. In both Arabidopsis and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Mge1 is induced by ultraviolet B light and Mge2 is induced by heat, which suggests regulatory divergence of the genes. Consistently, {AtMge}2 but not {AtMge}1 is under the control of {HsfA}1, the master regulator of the {HS} response. Heterologous expression of {AtMge}2 but not {AtMge}1 in the temperature-sensitive Escherichia coli {grpE} mutant restored its growth at 43°C. Arabidopsis T-{DNA} knockout lines under different {HS} regimes revealed that Mge2 is specifically required for tolerating prolonged exposure to moderately high temperature, as compared with the need of the heat shock protein 101 and the {HS}-associated 32-{kD} protein for short-term extreme heat. Therefore, with duplication and subfunctionalization, one copy of the Arabidopsis Mge genes became specialized in a distinct type of {HS}. We provide direct evidence supporting the connection between gene duplication and adaptation to environmental stress.},

	abstract = {Density dependence ({DD}) is a central concept in population ecology and in the management of harvested populations. For example, {DD} underpins the idea of additive versus compensatory mortality and is a tenet in the paradigm of resource limitation and regulation. Yet the prevalence and importance of {DD} remains disputed in most organisms, including ducks, which are focal in game management, conservation and zoonotic diseases. Based on 154 data entries from 54 studies in the peer-reviewed literature, we here synthesize and evaluate the prevalence of {DD} in breeding ducks in relation to (1) species and guild (dabbling versus diving ducks), (2) stage in the breeding cycle (nesting, duckling, recruitment) or, alternatively, in terms of population dynamics, (3) study type (descriptive/non-manipulative versus experimental), (4) continent (Europe versus North America), (5) spatial level (wetland, landscape, regional, continental) and (6) biome (tundra, boreal, nemoral, prairie, mediterranean). One conclusion from this review is that it is difficult to find general patterns about the prevalence of {DD} unless data are broken down to subsets, for example, to stage or spatial level. With respect to stage, {DD} effects occur at all stages of the breeding cycle. During the nesting and duckling stages, the frequency of cases detecting versus not detecting {DD} is roughly the same. However, in cases referring to the recruitment stage, i.e. to survival of fledged ducks until 1 year old at the most, {DD} was the rule, suggesting that {DD} processes may operate mainly outside the breeding season. Further subdivision of data shows that spatial scale is important to the prevalence of {DD} in nesting ducks—rare on the wetland level and more common on higher spatial levels. In studies of population dynamics (i.e. based on time series data only), {DD} was more often found in diving than in dabbling ducks. This corroborates previous suggestions that dabbling ducks largely should be considered as r-selected species, in contrast to more K-selected diving ducks, which start to reproduce at an older age and often breed in more stable wetland environments where resources may be easier to track and populations thus often are closer to carrying capacity. However, the picture of {DD} in ducks is far from complete, and knowledge gaps for future studies to address include: (a) data from Russia, which holds a large part of the breeding ducks in the Northern hemisphere, (b) experimental studies on more species to separate density-dependent factors from other drivers of population change and to tease apart spatial and temporal interactions in the underlying processes, (c) time series analyses addressing population dynamics, especially from outside North America, (d) studies relating duck numbers to limiting resources, which arguably is the most relevant measure of density, (e) the timing of {DD} processes in relation to harvest and natural mortality.},

The sequence of the Paramecium tetraurelia genome reveals a history of three successive whole-genome duplications ({WGDs}), and the sequence of Paramecium biaurelia and Paramecium sexaurelia suggests that these {WGDs} are shared by all members of the aurelia species complex. Here, we present the genome sequence of Paramecium caudatum, a species closely related to the Paramecium aurelia species group. P. caudatum shares only the most ancient of the three {WGDs} with the aurelia complex. We found that P. caudatum maintains twice as many paralogs from this early event as the P. aurelia species, suggesting that post-{WGD} gene retention is influenced by subsequent {WGDs}, and supporting the importance of selection for dosage in gene retention. The availability of P. caudatum as an outgroup allows an expanded analysis of the aurelia intermediate and recent {WGD} events. Both the {GC} content and the expression level of pre-duplication genes are significant predictors of duplicate retention. We find widespread asymmetrical evolution among aurelia paralogs, which is likely caused by gradual pseudogenization rather than by neofunctionalization. Finally, cases of divergent resolution of intermediate {WGD} duplicates between aurelia species implicate this process acts as an on-going reinforcement mechanism of reproductive isolation long after a {WGD} event.},

	abstract = {Nonnative species richness typically declines along environmental gradients such as elevation. It is usually assumed that this is because few invaders possess the necessary adaptations to succeed under extreme environmental conditions. Here, we show that nonnative plants reaching high elevations around the world are not highly specialized stress tolerators but species with broad climatic tolerances capable of growing across a wide elevational range. These results contrast with patterns for native species, and they can be explained by the unidirectional expansion of nonnative species from anthropogenic sources at low elevations and the progressive dropping out of species with narrow elevational amplitudes—a process that we call directional ecological filtering. Independent data confirm that climatic generalists have succeeded in colonizing the more extreme environments at higher elevations. These results suggest that invasion resistance is not conferred by extreme conditions at a particular site but determined by pathways of introduction of nonnative species. In the future, increased direct introduction of nonnative species with specialized ecophysiological adaptations to mountain environments could increase the risk of invasion. As well as providing a general explanation for gradients of nonnative species richness and the importance of traits such as phenotypic plasticity for many invasive species, the concept of directional ecological filtering is useful for understanding the initial assembly of some native floras at high elevations and latitudes.},

They can also be structural (e.g. when discovering {RNA} motifs). Finding common structural patterns helps to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action (e.g. post-transcriptional regulation). Unlike {DNA} motifs, which are sequentially conserved, {RNA} motifs exhibit conservation in structure, which may be common even if the sequences are different.

	abstract = {Experimental studies that explore the possible causes of ploidy distributions and niche differentiation are rare. Increased competitive ability may be advantageous for survival in dense vegetation and may strongly affect local and regional abundances of cytotypes and potentially contribute to invasion success. We compared survival, growth and reproduction of plants originating from bulbils of three cytotypes (2n = 4x, 5x, 6x) of Allium oleraceum growing with and without a competitor (Arrhenatherum elatius). There was a strong negative effect of competition but no effect of ploidy or ploidy × competition on survivorship, height and total dry mass of A. oleraceum, i.e. no support for different competitive abilities of the ploidy levels. However, slightly different responses of populations to competition treatments within all cytotypes suggest differentiation within cytotypes. Under competition, plant survivorship was low, surviving plants were small, had low dry mass and produced neither sexual nor asexual propagules. Without competition, plant survivorship was high, and cytotypes differed in three traits after 2 year's growth: dry mass of flowers, number of flowers and ratio of the dry mass of sexual to asexual propagules all decreased with increasing ploidy level. We additionally tested tetra- and pentaploids as to whether plants originating from different types of propagule (bulbils, seeds) differ in survivorship, growth and reproduction when growing with and without a competitor. Plants originating from bulbils had higher survivorship, were more robust, flowered earlier and produced more propagules when compared to plants originating from seeds and grown without competition. Under competition, differences in performance between plants originating from seeds and bulbils mostly disappeared, with higher survivorship only for plants originating from bulbils.},

	abstract = {Gene duplication is a major driver of organismal adaptation and evolution and plays an important role in multiple human diseases. Whole-genome analyses have shown similar and high rates of gene duplication across a variety of eukaryotic species. Most of these studies, however, did not address the possible impact of interlocus gene conversion ({IGC}) on the evolution of gene duplicates. Because {IGC} homogenizes pairs of duplicates, widespread conversion would cause gene duplication events that happened long ago to appear more recent, resulting in artificially high estimates of duplication rates. Although the majority of genome-wide studies (including in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Scer]) point to levels of {IGC} between paralogs ranging from 2\% to 18\%, Gao and Innan (Gao {LZ}, Innan H. 2004. Very low gene duplication rate in the yeast genome. Science 306:1367–1370.) found that gene conversion in yeast affected {\textgreater}80\% of paralog pairs. If conversion rates really are this high, it would imply that the rate of gene duplication in eukaryotes is much lower than previously reported. In this work, we apply four different methodologies—including one approach that closely mirrors Gao and Innan’s method—to estimate the level of {IGC} in Scer. Our analyses point to a maximum conversion level of 13\% between paralogs in this species, in close agreement with most estimates of {IGC} in eukaryotes. We also show that the exceedingly high levels of conversion found previously derive from application of an accurate method to an inappropriate data set. In conclusion, our work provides the most striking evidence to date supporting the reduced incidence of {IGC} among Scer paralogs and sets up a framework for future analyses in other eukaryotes.},

However, the mode, frequency, and timing of colonization of crater lakes have been difficult to determine. We used a statistical comparative phylogeographic approach, based on a {mitochondrialDNA} dataset, to infer the colonization history of two Nicaraguan crater lakes by populations of genetically and ecologically divergent cichlid lineages: Midas (Amphilophus cf. citrinellus complex) and moga (Hypsophrys nematopus). We compared estimates of diversity among populations within the two cichlid lineages and found that Midas were the most genetically diverse. From an approximate Bayesian computation analysis, we inferred that the crater lakes were each founded by both cichlid lineages in single waves of colonization: Masaya 5800 ± 300 years ago and Xiloá 5400 ± 750 years ago. We conclude that natural events are likely to have a dominant role in colonization of the crater lakes. Further, our findings suggest that the higher species richness and more rapid evolution of the Midas species complex, relative to other lineages of fishes in the same crater lakes, cannot be explained by earlier or more numerous colonization events.},

	abstract = {Background
The concept of a tree of life is prevalent in the evolutionary literature. It stems from attempting to obtain a grand unified natural system that reflects a recurrent process of species and lineage splittings for all forms of life. Traditionally, the discipline of systematics operates in a similar hierarchy of bifurcating (sometimes multifurcating) categories. The assumption of a universal tree of life hinges upon the process of evolution being tree-like throughout all forms of life and all of biological time. In multicellular eukaryotes, the molecular mechanisms and species-level population genetics of variation do indeed mainly cause a tree-like structure over time. In prokaryotes, they do not. Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of life are two different things, and we need to treat them as such, rather than extrapolating from macroscopic life to prokaryotes. In the following we will consider this circumstance from philosophical, scientific, and epistemological perspectives, surmising that phylogeny opted for a single model as a holdover from the Modern Synthesis of evolution.

Results
It was far easier to envision and defend the concept of a universal tree of life before we had data from genomes. But the belief that prokaryotes are related by such a tree has now become stronger than the data to support it. The monistic concept of a single universal tree of life appears, in the face of genome data, increasingly obsolete. This traditional model to describe evolution is no longer the most scientifically productive position to hold, because of the plurality of evolutionary patterns and mechanisms involved. Forcing a single bifurcating scheme onto prokaryotic evolution disregards the non-tree-like nature of natural variation among prokaryotes and accounts for only a minority of observations from genomes.

Conclusion
Prokaryotic evolution and the tree of life are two different things. Hence we will briefly set out alternative models to the tree of life to study their evolution. Ultimately, the plurality of evolutionary patterns and mechanisms involved, such as the discontinuity of the process of evolution across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide, summons forth a pluralistic approach to studying evolution.

	abstract = {Dynamic models of quantitative (polygenic) characters are more generally applicable in the analysis of life history evolution than are static optimization methods or one and two locus genetic models. A dynamic theory of life history evolution is derived by synthesizing population demography with quantitative genetics. In a population under weak selection with a nearly stable age distribution, the relative fitness of individuals with a particular life history phenotype can be approximated as an average of age-specific relative fecundity and mortality rates, weighted respectively by the present productivity and future reproductive value of each age-class. An adaptive topography is constructed showing that, with phenotype- and age-specific fecundity and mortality rates constant in time, evolution of the mean life history maximizes the intrinsic rate of increase of a population. However, the rate and direction of evolution in response to selection are strongly influenced by genetic correlations among characters. Negative genetic correlations among major components of fitness are often obscured phenotypically by positive environmental correlations, but commonly constitute the ultimate constraint on life history evolution, as illustrated by artificial selection experiments. Methods are suggested for measuring selective forces and evolutionary constraints that effect life history characters in natural populations.},

Multicelled “snowflake” yeast evolved from a unicellular ancestor after 7 days of selection for faster settling through liquid media. Over the next 220 days, snowflake yeast evolved to settle 44\% more quickly. Throughout the experiment the clusters evolved faster settling by three distinct modes. The number of cells per cluster increased from a mean of 42 cells after 7 days of selection to 114 cells after 227 days. Between days 28 and 65, larger clusters evolved via a twofold increase in the mass of individual cells. By day 227, snowflake yeast evolved to form more hydrodynamic clusters that settle more quickly for their size than ancestral strains. The timing and nature of adaptation in our experiment suggests that costs associated with large cluster size favor novel multicellular adaptations, increasing organismal complexity.},
