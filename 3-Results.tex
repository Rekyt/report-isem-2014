\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Constant environment and density-dependence}

We used the previously developed model in \citetext{Sandell et al. 2014, master's thesis} and simulated (see~\autoref{fig:dd}) a tree population for 150 years in constant environment, with and without density-dependence on $s_0$, to model a more realistic demography.

Indeed, density-dependence introduced a limit in the population (\autoref{fig:dd} right panel), as the number of mature and immature individuals seem to converge respectively to $18000$ and $10000$ individuals, while without density-dependence the population is exponentially growing.

Looking at the phenotype, we started from exactly the same starting point $z=116$ for phenotypic and genotypic values. Without density-dependence, the population quickly converge to the equilibrium phenotype ($\overline{z_{weak}}$ given by the approximation in~\autoref{eq:zweak}), $\overline{z_{weak}} = 166$ in this case. With density-dependence the equilibrium is shifted upward ($\overline{z_{weak, dd}} = 121.8$).

This shift is due to the decrease of $s_0$ in the density-dependent model, indeed because of the initial population $s_{0, dd} = 1.18 10^-3$ while $s_0 = 0.03$ without density-dependence. This difference, all else being equal, changes the equilibrium of $\overline{z_{weak}}$. With a lower seed survival, the equilibrium is shifted towards $\theta_s$, i.e. the survival optimum for immature, because it compensates to maintain the demographic equilibrium (growth rate = 1).

Within the density-dependent model the mean immature phenotype $\overline{z_I}$ converge quicker than the mean mature phenotype $\overline{z_M}$ to the equilibrium. It is because of stage-structured nature of our model, the mature stage is a combination of individuals that lived for around 40 generations (given our life-cycle), it buffers adaptation. To change $\overline{z_M}$, the individual have first to be closer to $\overline{z_{weak}}$ than to survive for a certain number of years and become mature. While the newborns of the given generation are already closer to the equilibrium.

\subsection*{Fluctuating optimums}

The noises were drawn from a bivariate normal distribution to make the optimums fluctuate. We varied the correlation between them.

Phenotype and approximations are shown in julian days, $\overline{z_\epsilon}$ is the approximation from \autoref{eq:zfluct}. Mean fecundities are in number of seeds produced. The two bottom rows are survival rates, the top one is $\overline{s_I}$ the mean survival of immature individuals, the bottom one is $s_0$ the rate of survival and germination of seeds (see~\nameref{sec:M&M}).}
