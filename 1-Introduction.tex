\section*{Introduction}

Rapid environmental change, IPCC, estimated temperature rise.

Trend to precocity in plants, flowering time, etc. Advance in phenology.

\textbf{Problem:} Understanding (and predicting?) long-lived plant adaptation to climate change

Based on previously developed demographic and quantitative genetics model (see \ref{sec:M&M}), added fluctuating environments. Made theoretical predictions. Estimated fluctuations using data from phenological data (PHENOFIT).
